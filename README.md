## Pre-Trained Model Used (BART)
![png](https://github.com/akshayparate123/SKY-Personal-AI/blob/main/Images/BART_arch.png)

1. **Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART)**: A Transformer-based model developed by Facebook AI for text generation and understanding tasks.
  
2. **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: BART combines both an encoder and a decoder, where the encoder reads the input text bidirectionally, and the decoder generates output autoregressively.

3. **Noise-based Pretraining**: BART is pretrained by corrupting text (e.g., token masking, shuffling) and then learning to reconstruct the original text, making it effective in handling a variety of text corruption patterns.

4. **Versatile NLP Tasks**: BART is used in tasks such as summarization, translation, question answering, and text generation due to its robust language understanding and generation capabilities.

5. **Fine-Tuning Potential**: The model can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, enabling it to adapt well to domain-specific applications and custom use cases.


## OCR Pipeline

1. **Prompting LLM**: Initiate the process by sending a user query to a Large Language Model (LLM).

2. **Triggering Function to Take Screenshot**: Execute a function that captures a screenshot of the current screen or specified area.

3. **Grayscale Image**: Convert the captured screenshot into a grayscale image to simplify the image processing.

4. **Divide the Image into Small Chunks**: Split the grayscale image into smaller segments for easier text extraction.

5. **Fetch Text from Image Using OCR**: Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from the divided image chunks.

6. **Merge the Text**: Combine the extracted text from all chunks into a single text block.

7. **Provide the Merged Text and User Query to LLM**: Send the merged text along with the original user query back to the LLM for further processing or response generation.


## RAG Pipeline

1. **User Query**: The process starts with a query from the user.

2. **Retrieval Step**: Relevant documents or knowledge snippets are retrieved from a database or document store using the query. Common retrieval methods include embeddings and similarity search.

3. **Candidate Selection**: The top retrieved documents are selected based on relevance to the query.

4. **Augmentation**: The selected documents are combined with the query to form an augmented input.

5. **Generation with LLM**: The augmented input is passed to a Large Language Model (LLM), which generates a response using both the query and the retrieved documents.

6. **Response Delivery**: The generated answer is provided back to the user, enriched with relevant information from the retrieval step.

**Conclusion**

The SKY Personal Assistant represents a significant advancement in virtual assistant technology. Its current capabilities, including question answering, information retrieval, task performance, summarization, user profiling, and continuous learning, make it an invaluable tool for users. The planned future enhancements, such as computer vision integration, advanced data analysis, and improved user interactions, promise to take its functionality to even greater heights. SKY is not just an assistant but a continuously evolving partner designed to make life easier and more efficient for its users. With SKY, the future of personal assistance is here, and itâ€™s brighter than ever.
