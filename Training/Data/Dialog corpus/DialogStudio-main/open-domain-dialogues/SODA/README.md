# SODA

SODA is the first publicly available, million-scale, high-quality dialogue dataset covering a wide range of social interactions. Dialogues are distilled from a PLM (InstructGPT; Ouyang et al., 2022) by contextualizing social commonsense knowledge from a knowledge graph (Atomic10x; West et al., 2022). Human evaluation shows that dialogues in SODA are more consistent, specific, and (surprisingly) natural than prior human-authored datasets – e.g., DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017), BlendedSkillTalk (Smith et al., 2020). Also, since social commonsense knowledge encompasses emotional reactions (i.e., the xReact relation), SODA includes 385K conversations labeled with 1.7K unique emotions along with information about the experiencer and the cause – i.e., PersonX and the head event in the symbolic commonsense knowledge triple.
