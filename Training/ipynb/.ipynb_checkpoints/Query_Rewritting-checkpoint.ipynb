      "To mitigate this problem, recent studies \\cite{xiong2023can, tian2023just, kuhn2023semantic, mielke2022reducing} have focused on measuring model uncertainty to quantify the reliability of their outputs. Reliability in dialogue systems refers to the system’s ability to consistently understand user inputs, retrieve relevant results or information when needed, generate appropriate responses, and handle uncertainties or errors effectively. A promising approach to improving reliability is through the estimation of confidence scores, which aim to provide a quantitative measure of the system’s uncertainty in its outputs. By incorporating confidence scores, dialogue systems can better manage uncertainties, identify potential errors, and make more informed decisions. For instance, a system with high confidence in its response can proceed smoothly, while one with low confidence can seek clarification from the user or escalate the query to a human operator. This dynamic adjustment based on confidence scores not only enhances the system’s reliability but also improves its overall performance and user satisfaction. \\begin{figure}[t] \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\linewidth]{TODS-Approach.png} \\caption{Example interaction in our TODS approach, showing DST and its outputs with confidence scores.}\n",

      "By multiplying these two confidence scores, we obtain a pair confidence score that reflects the confidence in the accuracy of both the slot and its corresponding value. In our preliminary experimentation, we tested whether using just the score of the slot or the value may result in better performance for the slot-value pair and converged to using the multiplied confidence in the equation above. From the task completion perspective, both the slot and the value should be accurate for retrieving accurate information from knowledge sources.\\\\ \\textit{B. Scores derived using The Surface Form:} This is a complementary approach, showing the logits in a non-generative fashion, so no beam search is necessary.

      "We report results both with and without controls. These controls include the age, gender, and educational level of the head of the household, the household size, an index of household assets, an index of livestock assets, and cloud cover for the week. When possible, we use Liang-Zeger cluster-robust standard errors at the unit of randomization: the household. This corrects for heteroskedasticity and serial correlation when we have multiple observations for a household. However, when the outcome is aggregated to a single value for the entire six week period, we only have one observation per household. In these cases, we implement Eicker-Huber-White robust standard errors to account for heteroskedasticity, since serial correlation, by construction, is no longer present. \\section{Results} We present results on the intermediate outcome of stove adoption, followed by results on our main outcomes of interest: dietary composition, cooking frequency, and fuel use. Before considering specific outcomes of interest, it is important to understand how the treated respond to their treatment status. We do this by estimating the ATE of being given a solar stove on actually using a solar stove to preapre a dish. While being assigned a stove is random, the choice to use the stove to prepare a given dish is not.\\footnote{As a robustness check, we use the difference between assignment and use to estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) in Online Appendix~\\ref{app:robust}.}\n",

      "Some obvious questions arise: What sets the speed limit on human behavior? And what can that teach us about the neural mechanisms of cognition? Before attempting an answer, we should agree on the magnitude of the question, which sets an expectation for the magnitude of the answer. We need to explain \\emph{a factor of a million} (conservatively), namely the ratio between peripheral information processing and the overall throughput of the brain. Numerically speaking, this may be the largest unexplained number in brain science. This order of magnitude sets a filter for hypothetical solutions. Suppose, for example, that a particular hypothesis explains why people process information two times faster in one task condition than in another. That might be enough for a paper in a prominent journal, but the tiny effect size doesn't even make a dent in the paradox. Obviously we should move on and read a different article. Next, we should consider whether one can simply deny the paradox. For many people, the claim that human mental activity is rather slow touches a sensitive nerve. Here we consider some of the objections that have been raised. \\subsection{What about photographic memory?} It is a popular belief that some people can memorize an entire page of text from a short glimpse, and then recall it as though they were reading an internal photograph.\n",

These four prompt variants are detailed in the supplementary material. Like previous work, we instructed the LLM to output in JSON format, using in-context examples.

      "We measure cooking frequency as either the number of dishes prepared in a meal or the number of meals skipped by a household. For each of our measures, we present estimates with and without controls by day, week, and overall. The results in Table~\\ref{tab:freq_out} show that households assigned a solar stove did not significantly change their cooking frequency. In general, the coefficients are in the direction we would expect; coefficients on the number of dishes prepared are positive and coefficients on the number of meals skipped are negative. This suggests that households are preparing more dishes at each meal and skipping fewer meals. On average, households in the control prepare about five dishes a day. Households with solar stoves prepare 0.1 more dishes or about two percent more dishes a day. Over the length of the experiment treatment households only prepare three more dishes than control households. More economically and nutritionally meaningful effects are present for meals skipped. Treatment households skip about one less meal than control households, who skip on average 26 meals during the 42 days of the study. It is more difficult to interpret the null findings for cooking frequency than the null results for dietary composition. Given that solar stoves provide another method of cooking that can augment cooking with fuel, and that using the stove is free of monetary costs, one would expect an increase in cooking frequency, particularly is households are energy stacking.\n",

      "\\textbf{Naive Finetune.} Human evaluators exhibited a stronger preference for preference agent outputs over naive fine-tuning compared to GPT-4o. Post-annotation interviews revealed that naive fine-tuning often resulted in hallucinations of crucial information, a phenomenon not effectively penalized by automated metrics but disliked by humans. \\textbf{No Baseline Agent.} The preference agent trained without access to zero-shot baseline information exhibits competitive performance, particularly when considering the marginal reduction in inference cost it offers. This makes it a viable alternative in scenarios where minimizing inference cost is a priority, even if it comes with a slight compromise in performance compared to the distillation-based approach. Both automated and human evaluations confirm that our preference agent significantly improves the alignment of LLM outputs with individual user styles and preferences, as discussed in Section \\ref{discussion:why-ft-more-effective}. The strong and consistent performance across diverse datasets and LLMs highlights the generalizability utilizing preference agents. Qualitative examples and human annotation samples of the results are provided in Appendix \\ref{appendix:qualitative_examples}. \\section{Discussion} \\subsection{Enhanced Fine-Tuning through Preference Rules} \\label{discussion:why-ft-more-effective} Our experiments (Figure \\ref{fig:ruleft_vs_naiveft}) reveal that fine-tuning the preference agent on natural language rules, as opposed to directly on input-output pairs, leads to a more effective learning process.\n",

      ": The Contested Role of History in Contemporary Debates on the Second Amendment 117 (J. Tucker, B. Hacker, & M. Vining eds. 2019) (explaining that guns in the 18th century took a long time to load, typically fired only one shot, and often misfired). According to the dissent, the so-lution cannot be \"materially different\" even when societal perception of the problem has changed, and even if it is now clear to everyone that the historical means of addressing the problem had been wholly inadequate. Given the fact that the law at the founding was more likely to protect husbands who abused their spouses than offer some measure of accountability, see, e.g., R. Siegel, \"The Rule of Love\": Wife Beating as Prerogative and Privacy, 105 Yale L. J. 2117, 2154-2170 (1996), it is no surprise that that generation did not have an equivalent to § 922(g)(8). Under the dissent's approach, the legislatures of today would be limited not by a distant generation's determination that such a law was unconstitutional, but by a distant generation's failure to consider that such a law might be necessary. History has a role to play in Second Amendment analysis, but a rigid adherence to history, (particularly history predating the inclusion of women and people of color as full members of the polity), impoverishes constitutional interpretation and hamstrings our democracy.\n",

      "we use the share of dishes that were cooked with a solar stove. Since the choice to use a solar stove to cook a specific dish is not random, we instrument for the use of the solar stove with the random assignment to treatment. As can be seen in Table~\\ref{tab:late_diverse}, coefficients on our measures of dietary diversity remain stastically insignificant. Though effect sizes are larger, as we would expect when comparing the LATE to the ITT, the estimates are less precise (larger standard errors), as we would also expect when using an instrumental variable. A similar pattern is present in Table~\\ref{tab:late_numdish}. While the LATE produces larger coefficients, they all remain insignificant as the standard errors also increase in size. Finally, Table~\\ref{tab:fuel_late} we report LATE estimates of the use of solar stoves on fuel. Again, coefficients increase in size. The more frequently a household uses a stove, the large time and cost savings that household experiences. While coefficients on firewood quantity and overall value remain significant, savings in terms of time becomes not significant due to the inflation of standard errors. Overall, our ITT results are robust to substitution with the LATE. While the ITT and LATE measure treatment effects in different populations, the two are related in well known ways.\n",

The functionality provided by the Sienna modeling framework was used as the production-cost simulation engine in the National Transmission Planning Study (NTP Study) (National Renewable Energy Laboratory [NREL] 2024; Lara et al. 2021). The choice of the Sienna modeling framework was a result of the range of libraries that make up Sienna being capable of efficient and reproducible data management, programmatic access (which enables reproducibility and dataset maintenance), and efficient storage and access to support large-scale modeling, validation, and change management (all enabled through the libraries part of Sienna\\Data). Nodal production cost modeling in Sienna (via Sienna\\Ops) is transparent, programmatic, and scalable, which enables validation and verification as well as the potential to develop further modeling functionality extensions.

      "Model architecture In line with our design philosophy, we opted for a relatively standard decoder-only transformer architecture in Llama 3. Compared to Llama 2, we made several key improvements. Llama 3 uses a tokenizer with a vocabulary of 128K tokens that encodes language much more efficiently, which leads to substantially improved model performance. To improve the inference efficiency of Llama 3 models, we’ve adopted grouped query attention (GQA) across both the 8B and 70B sizes. We trained the models on sequences of 8,192 tokens, using a mask to ensure self-attention does not cross document boundaries. Training data To train the best language model, the curation of a large, high-quality training dataset is paramount. In line with our design principles, we invested heavily in pretraining data. Llama 3 is pretrained on over 15T tokens that were all collected from publicly available sources. Our training dataset is seven times larger than that used for Llama 2, and it includes four times more code. To prepare for upcoming multilingual use cases, over 5% of the Llama 3 pretraining dataset consists of high-quality non-English data that covers over 30 languages. However, we do not expect the same level of performance in these languages as in English.\n",

Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[296] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[296] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[297] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[298] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics.[299] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.[300]\\n',\n",

       "   232: 'The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.[309][310] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".[r] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,[312] such as McCullouch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943,[115] and Turing\\'s influential 1950 paper \\'Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible.[313][310]\\n',\n",
       "   233: 'The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[s][6] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.[t] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[v][7] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[310]\\n',\n",
       "   234: 'Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.[317] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".[318] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation\\xa0... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved\".[319] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.[w] In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[321] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects.[322] Minsky\\'s and Papert\\'s book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.[323] The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.[9]\\n',\n",
       "   235: \"In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[324] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[8] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[10]\\n\",\n",
       "   236: 'Up to this point, most of AI\\'s funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition,[325] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches.[326] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[x] Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.[86][331] But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.[332] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.[333]\\n',\n",
       "   237: 'AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[334] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect).[335]\\nHowever, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[4]\\n',\n",

Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[z] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.[296]\\n\",\n",

The program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text.[340] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\".[341] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.[342]\\n',\n",

       "   242: 'Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.[343] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.[344] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will.[345] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.[344]\\n',\n",

Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"[347]\\n',\n",
       "   245: 'Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure.[1] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making \\'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.\\'\"[349] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".[350]\\n',\n",
       "   246: 'McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\".[351] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\".[352] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\\n',\n",
       "   247: 'Another definition has been adopted by Google,[353] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\\n',\n",

This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\\n',\n",

       "   252: 'Symbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\")[357] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[358]\\n',\n",
       "   253: 'However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec\\'s paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[359] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[360] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[ab][16]\\n',\n",
       "   254: 'The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[362][363] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision.

Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[364] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\\n',\n",

This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[367] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind.

The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett\\'s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[369]\\n',\n",

Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[370]\\n',\n",
