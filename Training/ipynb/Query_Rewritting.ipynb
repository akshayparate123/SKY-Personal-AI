      "To mitigate this problem, recent studies \\cite{xiong2023can, tian2023just, kuhn2023semantic, mielke2022reducing} have focused on measuring model uncertainty to quantify the reliability of their outputs. Reliability in dialogue systems refers to the system’s ability to consistently understand user inputs, retrieve relevant results or information when needed, generate appropriate responses, and handle uncertainties or errors effectively. A promising approach to improving reliability is through the estimation of confidence scores, which aim to provide a quantitative measure of the system’s uncertainty in its outputs. By incorporating confidence scores, dialogue systems can better manage uncertainties, identify potential errors, and make more informed decisions. For instance, a system with high confidence in its response can proceed smoothly, while one with low confidence can seek clarification from the user or escalate the query to a human operator. This dynamic adjustment based on confidence scores not only enhances the system’s reliability but also improves its overall performance and user satisfaction. \\begin{figure}[t] \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\linewidth]{TODS-Approach.png} \\caption{Example interaction in our TODS approach, showing DST and its outputs with confidence scores.}\n",

      "By multiplying these two confidence scores, we obtain a pair confidence score that reflects the confidence in the accuracy of both the slot and its corresponding value. In our preliminary experimentation, we tested whether using just the score of the slot or the value may result in better performance for the slot-value pair and converged to using the multiplied confidence in the equation above. From the task completion perspective, both the slot and the value should be accurate for retrieving accurate information from knowledge sources.\\\\ \\textit{B. Scores derived using The Surface Form:} This is a complementary approach, showing the logits in a non-generative fashion, so no beam search is necessary. We just compute the score of each given token in a response string using the LLM: \\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Conf}_{i}^{(\\text{LLM})} = \\log P(i|C_{<i};\\theta) \\end{equation} where $\\mathrm{Conf}_{i}^{(\\text{LLM})}$ denotes the confidence score of token $i$ with context $C_{<i}$, using the LLM with weights $\\theta$ following the Llama/GPT-style architecture~\\cite{radford2019language}.\n",

      "We report results both with and without controls. These controls include the age, gender, and educational level of the head of the household, the household size, an index of household assets, an index of livestock assets, and cloud cover for the week. When possible, we use Liang-Zeger cluster-robust standard errors at the unit of randomization: the household. This corrects for heteroskedasticity and serial correlation when we have multiple observations for a household. However, when the outcome is aggregated to a single value for the entire six week period, we only have one observation per household. In these cases, we implement Eicker-Huber-White robust standard errors to account for heteroskedasticity, since serial correlation, by construction, is no longer present. \\section{Results} We present results on the intermediate outcome of stove adoption, followed by results on our main outcomes of interest: dietary composition, cooking frequency, and fuel use. Before considering specific outcomes of interest, it is important to understand how the treated respond to their treatment status. We do this by estimating the ATE of being given a solar stove on actually using a solar stove to preapre a dish. While being assigned a stove is random, the choice to use the stove to prepare a given dish is not.\\footnote{As a robustness check, we use the difference between assignment and use to estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) in Online Appendix~\\ref{app:robust}.}\n",

      "Some obvious questions arise: What sets the speed limit on human behavior? And what can that teach us about the neural mechanisms of cognition? Before attempting an answer, we should agree on the magnitude of the question, which sets an expectation for the magnitude of the answer. We need to explain \\emph{a factor of a million} (conservatively), namely the ratio between peripheral information processing and the overall throughput of the brain. Numerically speaking, this may be the largest unexplained number in brain science. This order of magnitude sets a filter for hypothetical solutions. Suppose, for example, that a particular hypothesis explains why people process information two times faster in one task condition than in another. That might be enough for a paper in a prominent journal, but the tiny effect size doesn't even make a dent in the paradox. Obviously we should move on and read a different article. Next, we should consider whether one can simply deny the paradox. For many people, the claim that human mental activity is rather slow touches a sensitive nerve. Here we consider some of the objections that have been raised. \\subsection{What about photographic memory?} It is a popular belief that some people can memorize an entire page of text from a short glimpse, and then recall it as though they were reading an internal photograph.\n",

These four prompt variants are detailed in the supplementary material. Like previous work, we instructed the LLM to output in JSON format, using in-context examples.

      "We measure cooking frequency as either the number of dishes prepared in a meal or the number of meals skipped by a household. For each of our measures, we present estimates with and without controls by day, week, and overall. The results in Table~\\ref{tab:freq_out} show that households assigned a solar stove did not significantly change their cooking frequency. In general, the coefficients are in the direction we would expect; coefficients on the number of dishes prepared are positive and coefficients on the number of meals skipped are negative. This suggests that households are preparing more dishes at each meal and skipping fewer meals. On average, households in the control prepare about five dishes a day. Households with solar stoves prepare 0.1 more dishes or about two percent more dishes a day. Over the length of the experiment treatment households only prepare three more dishes than control households. More economically and nutritionally meaningful effects are present for meals skipped. Treatment households skip about one less meal than control households, who skip on average 26 meals during the 42 days of the study. It is more difficult to interpret the null findings for cooking frequency than the null results for dietary composition. Given that solar stoves provide another method of cooking that can augment cooking with fuel, and that using the stove is free of monetary costs, one would expect an increase in cooking frequency, particularly is households are energy stacking.\n",
