About the team
We are the FIS Embedded Finance team, and our mission is to enable developers across all verticals to imagine, create and monetize financial products to profoundly transform the way the entire financial industry consumes services. Today, it's difficult for many businesses to build the financial products they imagine.

We make it trivially easy for businesses to compliantly offer financial products and innovate on their key differentiators rather than spend all their time building and maintaining financial infrastructure.
