Additionally, the absence of interactive learning opportunities such as group give and take or hands - on exercises hindered engagement and practical application of concept. Without these opportunities, it was difficult to see the practical relevance of the course content.

Plus, Shaq thinks that DeAndre Ayton is a great player, but he shouldn\\'t strive to be the next Shaq but rather the first Ayton, and he hopes Ayton breaks his records. Shaq is also happy for Dwyane Wade, we recap the insanity from the Lost Lands Music Festival, and debate whether Shaq could take Henry Cavill\\'s place as the new Superman. We do a proper full \"Senselessly Sensitive\" segment this week, we try to get back in the hunt in the PodcastOne Sportsnet NFL Challenge, of course we get Borderline, and we play a round of the classic \"Walmart or Waffle House!\" Get into the mix on Twitter by following @Shaqcast or using #Shaqcast - follow The Big Podcast with Shaq on Instagram and Facebook - or email your best stuff to TheBigPodcastWithShaq@gmail.com.

(AP) \\n  \\n I’m sorry to break it to you, but Shaquille O’Neal is apparently a flat-Earther, too. Actually, I’m not sorry at all. I love this NBA narrative so, so much, and I’d like to thank Shaq for breathing more life into it. \\n  \\n Cleveland Cavaliers star Kyrie Irving was the first NBA player to reveal his flat-Earth beliefs, summarized as such: “Can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what’s going on with these ‘planets’ and stuff like this?” \\n  \\n Soon afterwards, Denver Nuggets wing Wilson Chandler and Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green endorsed Irving’s flat-Earth theory, with the latter explaining away NASA’s photos of the planet from space by suggesting everyone can manipulate doctored photos of the globe on their phones. \\n  \\n [Follow Ball Don’t Lie on social media: Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr] \\n  \\n The NBA storyline became so outrageous commissioner Adam Silver had to address it in his annual state-of-the-league address at the All-Star Game, clarifying, “I believe the world is round,” and suggesting Irving was making some broader social commentary about fake news in this country. \\n  \\n Which, no he wasn’t. Irving doubled down on his flat-Earth theory this past week, before detailing his lucid dreaming skills and informing us how an ex-teammate came to him in a dream to say goodbye. \\n  \\n These are all very real things that NBA players have said. \\n  \\n This is one wild theme to the 2016-17 NBA season, and Shaq just made it wilder when asked about Irving’s flat-Earth theory on his podcast. This was his response, through a series of interruptions: \\n  \\n Shaq is a flat-Earther, too I’m speechless I love this NBA narrative so muchhttps://t.co/eijTsZKJZm pic.twitter.com/3zOLbABfeQ — Ben Rohrbach (@brohrbach) March 19, 2017 \\n  \\n Story Continues \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n “It’s true. The Earth is flat. The Earth is flat. Yes, it is. Listen, there are three ways to manipulate the mind — what you read, what you see and what you hear. In school, first thing they teach us is, ‘Oh, Columbus discovered America,’ but when he got there, there were some fair-skinned people with the long hair smoking on the peace pipes. So, what does that tell you? Columbus didn’t discover America. So, listen, I drive from coast to coast, and this s*** is flat to me. I’m just saying. I drive from Florida to California all the time, and it’s flat to me. I do not go up and down at a 360-degree angle, and all that stuff about gravity, have you looked outside Atlanta lately and seen all these buildings? You mean to tell me that China is under us? China is under us? It’s not. The world is flat.” \\n  \\n This man has a doctorate degree in education from Barry University in Miami, Fla. Seriously. \\n  \\n I’m not sure which detail I enjoyed better — Shaq thinking the world is flat because he drives coast to coast or Shaq thinking he’d be driving “up and down at a 360-degree angle” if the Earth was spherical. \\n  \\n Unfortunately, you can’t drive from here to Asia, but there are things called boats and airplanes, and if you head west from California, you’ll arrive in China. And if you head west from there, you’ll eventually end up in California again. Because we live on a globe. Shaq should know full well. He’s been to China. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n And, technically, a 360-degree angle is just a circle. I don’t know why Shaq thinks you would be driving up and down on a circle, but it is possible to drive comfortably on a spherical object when that object’s circumference is 24,901 miles. Think of an ant walking around a basketball, if you will. It might think it’s moving in a straight line, but eventually it will navigate the orb and arrive in the same place. \\n  \\n [Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Basketball contest now] \\n  \\n Also, there are things called mountains, and you drive over them on your way to California. At various angles. But never at a 360-degree angle, because your car would just be careening in circles into a ravine. But we shouldn’t have to explain mountains to you, just how we shouldn’t have to tell you the Earth is not flat. And that’s what’s so great about this new NBA narrative. It raises so many questions, from where players think the sun goes at night to why they believe they travel to different time zones. \\n  \\n Of course, there remains the possibility that Shaq is just trolling us all. In which case, kudos to him for coming up with some fantastically elaborate fiction about how China cannot be under us, because I can’t get enough of NBA players and their flat-Earth theories — real or imaginary. Keep ’em coming. \\n  \\n – – – – – – – \\n  \\n Ben Rohrbach is a contributor for Ball Don’t Lie and Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?

       "'– Apparently there\\'s a belief circulating in the NBA that the Earth is flat. Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers first revealed his flat-Earth beliefs back in February, and now retired basketball player Shaquille O\\'Neal has revealed he\\'s on the same page. In an episode of his podcast broadcast late February but only recently picked up by the media, Shaq said, per Sports Illustrated: \"It’s true. The Earth is flat. The Earth is flat. Yes, it is. Listen, there are three ways to manipulate the mind—what you read, what you see, and what you hear.\" He used an example involving Christopher Columbus, arguing that Columbus didn\\'t really discover America because there were already \"fair-skinned people\" living here when Columbus arrived. Then he got into the real nitty gritty. He explained that he drives from coast to coast, and it certainly seems flat to him: \"I’m just saying. I drive from Florida to California all the time, and it’s flat to me. I do not go up and down at a 360-degree angle, and all that stuff about gravity, have you looked outside Atlanta lately and seen all these buildings? You mean to tell me that China is under us? China is under us? It’s not. The world is flat.\" Kenny Ducey at SI says that while he wants to believe this is all a joke, both Irving and O\\'Neal seem to be taking it seriously; Irving, for example, has continued to defend his beliefs. Ben Rohrbach at Yahoo Sports, who first uncovered the Shaq podcast, agrees that Irving is not kidding around (or trying to make some sort of point about \"fake news,\" as NBA commissioner Adam Silver suggested), and points out that at least two other NBA players have agreed with him.'"

A Russian woman hanged herself after having drunken sex with her ex-boyfriend, behind her new partner\\'s back. Alina Bogdanova was found lifeless by Aleksandrs Zuks, 29, the next morning, after the pair rekindled their romance, an inquest today heard. The 28-year-old blonde had spent the night of October 25 last year with her ex-boyfriend, who lived with her brother in Spalding, Lincolnshire.

Mr Zuks found the 28-year-old\\'s lifeless body the morning after the pair rekindled their romance last October . Giving evidence at an inquest at South Lincolnshire Coroners Court, Mr Zuks, said: \\'We slept together after she came to my bedroom. \\'I fell asleep with her beside me but found her the next morning. I thought she was standing on the stairway next to the wall. \\'I started talking and asking what she was doing there and when I came closer I realised that her bottom lip was blue.\\' At the time of her death, Miss Bogdanova was in a relationship with fellow Russian Arturas Pakalniskis, who lived in Peterborough. He told the inquest: \\'She was very happy. She wasn’t depressed. \\'I knew Mr Zuks lived at her brother’s address but I was not concerned (about her visiting the house). \\'She just said that \"I am going to see my brother\" and that was it.\\' Miss Bogdanova was visiting her brother Arnis, who lived with Mr Zuks in Spalding, Lincolnshire on October 25 last year. Mr Zuks told an inquest into her death she had fallen asleep beside him . South Lincolnshire assistant coroner Siobhan Kelly recorded a verdict of suicide.

She was so full of life\\' Miss Bogdanova’s brother Arnis told the hearing he had arranged for his sister to sleep in his room while he would use the sofa downstairs. He told the hearing he text her to say \\'come to bed\\' and she replied \\'sleep well\\'. The next morning she was found dead on the landing.

       "\"An Australian father who is believed to have been brainwashed by the preachings of Islamic extremist Musa Cerantonio has joined the ranks of terror group Islamic State to fight in the Middle East. According to Twitter, Zia Abdul Haq's current location is in an IS-controlled area of Ash-Shaam, also known as Syria. Friends of the 33-year-old believed the man from Logan - south of Brisbane - was moving to Syria to look for a new wife after the breakdown of his marriage, but The Courier Mail has revealed Abdul Haq is in fact fighting with the extremist organisation. Scroll down for video . The friends of Zia Abdul Haq says the father-of-one, from Logan, is a 'good-hearted guy' Two of Australia's most notorious jihadists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar are part of the same group. Abdul Haq is one of the latest of three men who are believed to have joined IS, including Melbourne's Abu Khaled al-Cambodi and Mounir Raad. The 33-year-old's friends described him as a 'good-hearted guy' but had been 'brainwashed' by Cerantonio - who is believed to be an influential IS figure - after hearing the radical sheik speak in Brisbane two years ago. The 33-year-old's friends claim he was brainwashed by prominent IS supporter, Musa Cerantonio - a radical sheik . 'He wasn’t a bad guy but he fell off the rails and under the spell of the extremists,' friend Yehya El-Kholed told The Courier Mail. 'Sheik Cerantonio is a hypocrite because while he urges people to go to Syria, he won’t go himself.' Since he landed in Syria, Abdul Haq - who came to Australia in his 20s and took up a job as a finance officer - has been actively posting photos depicting life as a fighter for IS on the social media site. These include M16 training, jihadists playing violent video games and cooking up a shared meal. But like Sharrouf and Elomar, Abdul Haq - who has a young son - has used Twitter as platform to fire off threatening messages, including one to foreign forces to 'bring dead body bag for each of your soldiers'. Most recently, he took aim at the U.S. saying 'Send you (men) to fight us, your drones are useless on the ground'  and 'How come you fight #IS with your gays & lesbians army' on Saturday night. Abdul Haq has also hit back at media outlets circulating news about him. 'Many lies about me in Australian news. =/,' he tweeted within half an hour of reports emerging. Since arriving in Syria Abdul Haq has been posting photos on Twitter of what it is like being an IS fighter . Last month Musa Cerantonio was deported back to Australia from the Philippines after he was arrested after breaching the Philippines' immigration laws. Changing his name from Robert Edward, the 29-year-old was detained in the central Filipino city of Cebu where he was believed to have been hiding from Australian authorities, despite claiming on Twitter he had arrived in the Middle East just days before his arrest. He was found with a Filipino fashion designer claiming to be his wife, inside an apartment. Australian authorities cancelled his passport, triggering his arrest and leaving without any documentation. He was then set free when he arrived in Melbourne after deportation as he had not broken any Australian laws. Musa Cerantonio is thought to be an influential IS figure and Abdul Haq is believed to have taken up extremist views after hearing the sheik speak in 2012 in Brisbane .\""

       "\"agent_1:Could you write a brief summary of this paragraph for me?'This introductory subject course provided a mixed bag of read experiences. On the positive side, the instructor clearly presented the core concepts, making them accessible to most students. The course materials were also helpful, offering additional information that complemented the lectures. This combination provided a solid foundation for further exploration of the field. However, there were areas where the course could improve. Firstly, while the breadth of topics covered was appropriate, some important areas feel rushed and superficial, leaving some students with a shallow understanding. Additionally, while the instructor was knowledgeable, the course trust heavily on traditional lectures, which can sometimes feel peaceful and disengaging. Incorporating more interactive activities, such as collaborative projects, simulation, or even debates on relevant topics, could significantly enhance engagement and foster deeper eruditeness. Overall, the course provided a decent introduction to the subject matter, but it has the potential to be much solid. By addressing the areas of improvement, particularly by incorporating more in - depth exploration, interactive learning activities, and a diverse teaching approach, the course could provide a more valuable and enrich learning experience for future students.'\""
