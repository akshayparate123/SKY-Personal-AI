The young woman, living with her cousin Bhaskar, is lured back to her hometown under the pretense of staging a stage play.

A stoner beggar who witnesses the abduction confirms the ghost's existence, but the group is left stunned by the prospect of the abducted women being held captive in an alternate dimension. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the girl is actually the spirit of Chandrabhan, an alcoholic and womanizer who beheaded her husband and burned them alive in front of her daughter. After her death, Chandabhan returned as a spirit to target progressive women. With the help of Vicky, Bittu, and Rudra, they manage to track down the missing women and ultimately defeat the evil spirit.

2024_10_05 Model Response: Sure sir, here�s the rephrased rendition of it.In 1952, a young man named Gotya fell deeply in love with Munni, but fate had other plans for him. As fate would have it, Munjya, the malevolent spirit, took him to a dense jungle called Chetukwadi to perform black magic under a peepal tree. Despite his best efforts to protect his sister, Bittu ultimately met his untimely demise when he tried to sacrifice his own body. This event led to the emergence of Munji, an evil spirit that haunts the tree and threatens to take over the world.

Years later, in the bustling city of Pune, Getya's grandmother, Gita, was killed while trying to save him from Munja's clutches. Driven by love for his beloved, he sought help from an exorcist named Elvis, who devised a plan to transfer the spirit to another man. However, things took a turn for the worse when Bela's boyfriend, Kuba, proposed to her, leaving him heartbroken. It wasn't until she returned from her studies in America that Gotu learned about her true nature.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2:� A road construction project in India's Arunachal Pradesh state has been canceled after two people were killed by a werewolf, the Times of India reports. According to the Hindustan Times, road contractor Bhaskar and his cousin Janardan "JD" were visiting the forest in Ziro when they were bitten by the wolf on the backside. Anika, a local veterinarian, managed to save him, but the next day he started seeing changes in himself, including heightened senses of smell and hearing, as well as communication with animals. Meanwhile, locals and tribals were against the idea of chopping down trees to build roads. The project was canceled. It was later revealed that Anikar had been the victim of a wolf attack a century ago. She says she was responsible for killing anyone who tried to kill the animal and has no control over it.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2:� It�s been a while since the term �artificial intelligence� was coined, but a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that it may soon be obsolete. The study, which looked at more than 1,000 artificial intelligence systems, found that the number of people living in countries where AI is already prevalent has dropped from 1.5 million to just over 1 million over the past 20 years, reports the Washington Post. That number is expected to continue to drop as more people move to countries with high levels of AI, such as China and India, where the rate of population growth has been outpacing that of those in developed countries, the Post notes. "We are seeing a slow, steady decline in AI as a whole," says the lead author of the study. In fact, by 2050, only a handful of countries will have machines that can perform tasks that are comparable to those of a human, according to a press release. And that number could drop to as few as 100 million by 2040, meaning AI will be mostly confined to developing countries that have large amounts of human-like population centers. (In other AI news, researchers are working on ways to make robots smarter.)

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2: When it comes to computers, there are a lot of things you just don't know about. For example, how many computers are there in the world? How many of them are connected to each other? And what kind of information do they have? Well, the answer to these questions isn't quite as clear as you might think, according to a new study by the University of California at Berkeley. The researchers looked at how computers interact with one another, and found that most of the information they get comes from external sources, such as social media or other forms of communication, reports the Los Angeles Times. In fact, computers have more information about their environment than humans do, making them more likely to make decisions based on what they see as a "good situation" or "bad situation," the researchers write in a paper published in Science Advances. What's more, they say computers can learn more about other computers than we do about ourselves, which makes it easier for them to learn new things and improve their decision-making skills. "If you have a computer with a good environment, you can make better decisions," one researcher tells the Times, adding that computers may be able to "learn from the data" and make more informed decisions.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2: A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that computers can learn a lot more about language than ever before. The study, which looked at how computers learn to read, write, and communicate in a wide range of languages, found that humans are able to learn more than 70% of a language's vocabulary in just a few years, reports the Guardian. That's up from just 25% a decade ago, according to a press release from the study. "We have shown that the human brain is capable of learning a whole new language every day," the lead author says. It's no wonder, then, that researchers are so confident in their ability to write complex sentences with high levels of accuracy. In fact, the researchers say that by 2023, human language models could be used in fields such as bar exams, SAT tests, GRE testsand many other real-world applications. (In other words, it's not too far-fetched to say computers could soon be learning to speak, too.)

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2: We've all heard the saying, "intelligence is in the eye of the beholder." But it turns out that even the most complex forms of intelligencelike that of a waspcan't always be classified as such, according to a new study published in Nature Communications. The study, which looked at the behavior of more than 1,000 species of wasps, found that while most insects exhibit some level of "intelligent behavior" when they return to their burrows to find food, only a small percentage of them can be identified as having high levels of cognitive ability, reports the Guardian. In fact, the study's lead author says that in many cases, intelligence is simply a function of being able to adapt to new circumstances, rather than a trait. "Intelligence is a combination of many diverse abilities," he says, including problem-solving, logical reasoning, and the ability to make decisions quickly and efficiently. And while there may be some overlap between intelligence and other cognitive abilities, it's important to note that there's no one trait that can reliably predict intelligence.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2: Its not every day we hear about a math problem that requires the use of deductive reasoning, but that's exactly what happens in the realm of artificial intelligence, according to a new study. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, used statistical models to determine that the probability of a certain event occurring is 1 in 100,000, reports the Los Angeles Times. They compared that with the chance of an event happening in any given scenario, and found that odds of it occurring were one in 10 million. This is one of the strongest cases of statistical inference we have ever seen, says the lead researcher. The study builds on previous work that has shown that such a scenario can be predicted with high confidence. In other words, the results of this experiment could be used to predict future events in a way that makes sense based on the available data.

2024_10_05 Model Response: In ancient times, a group of spiritual leaders from the Himalayas came face-to-face with the malevolent force known as Brahmastra, which possessed the power to obliterate the universe. These skilled beings harnessed their own astras to subdue the unpredictable nature of the Brahmansh, an enigmatic organization dedicated to safeguarding the world from its sinister might.

As fate would have it, in present-day Mumbai, Shiva finds himself smitten with Isha Chatterjee, who happens to be visiting India for the Durga Puja festival at her grandfathers palace.

2024_10_10 Model Response: agent_2: The world is mourning the death of India's richest man, Ratan Tata, who died Thursday at the age of Tatas Tata Steel Limited in Mumbai, India. Tata had been suffering from cancer for years, but his company, Tata Motors, was one of the world's largest and most valuable companies, according to the New York Times. The Times notes that Tata was worth more than $70 billion, making him worth as much as Bill Gates, Amancio Ortega, and Jeff Bezos combined. In a statement, the Indian conglomerate said Tata "gained another legacy, while losing one." "He showed us that true leadership isn't about being the loudest voice in the room or the heaviest hand on the table," the statement said.

BBC Future presents a four-minute animated guide to one of the greatest questions weve tried to solve.You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big space is,said the author Douglas Adams. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space. By our best estimates there are around 100 billion stars in the Milky Way and at least 140 billion galaxies across the Universe. If galaxies were frozen peas, there would be enough to fill an auditorium the size of the Royal Albert Hall.So how was this unimaginably giant Universe created? For centuries scientists thought the Universe always existed in a largely unchanged form, run like clockwork thanks to the laws of physics. But a Belgian priest and scientist called George Lemaitre put forward another idea. In 1927, he proposed that the Universe began as a large, pregnant and primeval atom, exploding and sending out the smaller atoms that we see today.His idea went largely unnoticed. But in 1929 astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the Unive", "imaginably giant Universe created? For centuries scientists thought the Universe always existed in a largely unchanged form, run like clockwork thanks to the laws of physics. But a Belgian priest and scientist called George Lemaitre put forward another idea. In 1927, he proposed that the Universe began as a large, pregnant and primeval atom, exploding and sending out the smaller atoms that we see today.His idea went largely unnoticed. But in 1929 astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the Universe isnt static but is in fact expanding. If so, some scientists reasoned that if you rewound the Universe's life then at some point it should have existed as a tiny, dense point. Critics dismissed this: the celebrated astronomer Fred Hoyle sarcastically called this concept the Big Bang theory, a phrase that would later be adopted by its proponents.Undeterred by sceptics, scientists Ralph Alpher, George Gamow and Robert Herman predicted that if there had been a Big Bang, then a faint afterglow should linger somewhere in the Universe, and we should in theory be able to detect it. To do so would require one of the greatest pieces of fortune in science.In the mid-1960s Astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were having a tough time trying to tune into the microwave signals transmitted from the Milky Way. The radio antenna they were using kept picking up a persistent weak hiss of radio noise. Rebuilding the antenna couldnt get rid of the noise. Nor could clearing the pigeons that had roosted in there, or their mess. Thats because the hiss they tried so hard to remove was the echo of the Big Bang, or the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation as it is known. If the Big Bang theory is true, how did it lead to all the planets, stars and galaxies we can see today? Thanks to a series of calculations, observations from telescopes on Earth and probes in space, our best explanation is this.Around 13.8 billion years ago, all the matter in the Universe emerged from a single, minute point, or singularity, in a violent burst. This expanded at an astonishingly high rate and temperature, doubling in size every 10-34 seconds, creating space as it rapidly inflated.

Specifically, ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight triggers the formation of vitamin D3 from the compound 7-dehydrocholesterol in skin (2). A similar process takes place in plants and mushrooms, where UVB light leads to the formation of vitamin D2 from ergosterol, a compound found in plant oils (3). If you regularly spend time outdoors, lightly clad and without sunscreen, you may be getting all the vitamin D you need.In Indian people, an estimated half an hour of midday sun twice a week provides the adequate amount (4).Just keep in mind that this duration of exposure does not apply in countries farther away from the equator. In these countries, you may need more time to achieve the same results.Nevertheless, be careful not to spend too much time in the sun without sunscreen. This is especially important if you have light-colored skin. Sunburns are a major risk factor for skin cancer (5).Unlike dietary vitamin D, you cannot overdose on vitamin D3 produced in your skin. If your body already has enough, your skin simply produces less. That said, many people get very little sun. They either work indoors or live in a country that doesnt get much sunlight during the winter.

These two compounds are collectively known as calcifediol. Calcifediol is the main circulating form of vitamin D, and its blood levels reflect your bodys stores of this nutrient.For this reason, your health care provider can estimate your vitamin D status by measuring your levels of calcifediol (6). However, vitamin D2 seems to yield less calcifediol than an equal amount of vitamin D3.Most studies show that vitamin D3 is more effective than vitamin D2 at raising blood levels of calcifediol (7, 8).For example, one study in 32 older women found that a single dose of vitamin D3 was nearly twice as effective as vitamin D2 at raising calcifediol levels (9).If you are taking vitamin D supplements, consider choosing vitamin D3.Summary Vitamin D3 appears to be better than D2 at improving vitamin D status.Summary Vitamin D2 Supplements Might Be Lower QualityScientists have raised concerns that vitamin D2 supplements might be lower quality than D3 supplements. In fact, studies suggest vitamin D2 is more sensitive to humidity and fluctuations in temperature. For this reason, vitamin D2 supplements may be more likely to degrade over time (10).However, whether this is relevant to human health is unknown. Also, no studies have compared the stability of vitamin D2 and D3 dissolved in oil. Until new research proves otherwise, you shouldnt worry about the quality of your vitamin D2 supplements. Simply make sure to store your supplements in a closed container, at room temperature, in a dry place and out of direct sunlight.Summary Vitamin D2 supplements may be more likely to degrade during storage. However, its unknown whether the same applies to oil-based vitamin D2. More studies are needed to examine the relevance of this to human health.Summary How to Improve Your Vitamin D StatusFortunately, there are many ways you can improve your vitamin D status. Below are a few ideas:Select mushrooms that have been exposed to ultraviolet light (11) Take fish oil supplements such as cod liver oilEat fatty fish twice a week (12) Choose milk or orange juice thats been fortified with vitamin DEat some eggs a']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.838731542371959, 0.8390434828433945]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}

When exposed to sunlight, your skin produces vitamin d3 through the production of 7-dehydrocholesterol in skin (2). This same process occurs in plants and mushrooms, where UVB light leads to the formation of vitamin dioxide from ergosterol, a compound found in plant oils (3). Therefore, if you regularly spend time outdoors, lightly clad, and without sunscreen, you may be getting all the Vitamin D you need. Sunburns are a major risk factor for skin cancer (5), but you cannot overdose on this vitamin if your body already has enough. However, many people get very little sun.

Research Says MaybeThere may be some health benefits to smelling farts. However, having too much gas or gas that occurs with other symptoms may point to an underlying health condition. So youre lying in bed, cuddling with your partner, and you hear it.Maybe its a silent hiss, maybe its a voluminous blare. But you recognize the announcement of its arrival no matter what form it takes.Gas. Flatulence. A toot. A fart.But ignore your immediate instinct to leap out of bed and take shelter in the next room until the smell subsides. Recent research in animals suggests that hydrogen sulfide  one of the major components of smelly gas, the one that gives it that rotten egg smell  might provide some health benefits in humans, from preventing heart disease to kidney failure. Lets explore this seemingly odious notion and see what the research says. What the research says One 2014 study conducted by a collaborative research team at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom and University of Texas provides some ample support for the idea that smelling hydrogen sulfide could be good for you. The study was based on the notion that mitochondria, the part of your cells that help produce energy, could benefit from this gas.In this study, researchers noticed that when cells in arteries or veins experience damage or stress linked to certain conditions, these cells use the bodys own enzymes to create hydrogen sulfide. This gas then allows the cell to better regulate the oxidative stress often caused by these conditions, which eventually results in inflammation that can kill the cell. But as a condition becomes more severe, mitochondria cant produce enough of the gas to keep up, and the disease continues to get worse.Researchers thus decided to test a theory: Can exposing cells to artificial hydrogen sulfide help keep their mitochondria strong and prevent diseases from getting worse?So, they created a compound they named AP39 that mimicked hydrogen sulfide. They then exposed cells in blood vessels to it.The result?AP39 was just as good as natural hydrogen sulfide at helping mitochondria protect themselves from disease. Early results suggest that up to 80 percent of mitochondria exposed to AP39 are preserved by the gas. This could have far-reaching effects on many conditions linked to cell death caused by mitochondrial function. More research needs to be done on the interactions of AP39/hydrogen sulfide with other body systems, but early resul', 'Our product picks are editor-tested, expert-approved. We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us?Farting might be embarrassingespecially when its noticeable (sound, smell). But its actually important for your health.There are benefits to letting it rip throughout the day (most of them go undetected, anyway.) Farting can tell us a lot about our digestive health. Its actually very normal to pass gas over a dozen times a day, and lack of gas may indicate less diversity in lower digestive tract bacteria, says Kelly Jones MS, RD, CSSD, LDN, of Kelly Jones Nutrition. Having a diverse microbiome is important to good health in many ways, including improved mood and fitness performance, better heart health, and a healthier immune system. If you arent farting enough, see a doctor to better understand why and how to get things moving better in your digestive system. In the meantime, start making your microbiome more diverse with these strategies. But if you are farting frequently enough, heres what its doing for you: Farting is telling you youre getting good, complex carbs A diet rich in legumes, vegetables, fruits, whole grains nuts and seeds has long been associated with health benefits, and a healthy amount of flatulence can be indicative of this, says Jones. These foods provide fermentable fiber, resistant starches and oligosaccharides, which are all complex carbohydrates that good bacteria ferment and feed off of in the lower digestive tract. Gas is a byproduct of this fermentation, and thats what you release when you fart. So, by farting, you know youre getting a good variety of these types of fibrous foods to improve your gut health and the microbiome that helps keep it going.It improves colon healthYup, thats rightfarting can keep your colon happy now and lower the risk of colon complications in the future.

2024_10_23 Context(Action): {'ids': [['7788607525.04', '2897260573.04']], 'embeddings': None, 'documents': [['itionHow Much Iron Should You Be Getting Daily?How much iron you need can depend on your age and whether you are menstruating, pregnant, or nursing. The body absorbs certain types of iron differently.Too much or too little iron in your diet can lead to health issues like liver problems, iron-deficiency anemia, and heart damage (1).Naturally, you may wonder just how much iron is an ideal amount. Heres where it gets a little tricky.While generalized recommendations offer some guidance, your specific iron needs are influenced by many factors, including age, sex, and diet.This article discusses how much iron you may need, factors impacting those needs, and how to tell if youre not getting the right amount.Iron  what is it and why is it important?Iron is a nutrient that plays a vital role in oxygen transport. It binds to hemoglobin, a special protein, and helps it carry red blood cells from your lungs to other tissues in your body (1).Iron is naturally available in the foods you eat, and there are two main types  heme and nonheme iron.The term heme is derived from a Greek word that loosely translates to blood. This type of iron comes from animal protein, such as poultry, fish, and beef.On the other hand, nonheme iron comes from plant sources, including legumes, leafy greens, and nuts.Heme iron is easiest for your body to absorb and is 1418% bioavailable in mixed diets. Nonheme iron, the iron source in vegetarian diets, has a bioavailability of 512% (2).summaryIron is an essential nutrient. Two types of iron are found in the human diet  heme iron comes from animal protein, while nonheme iron comes from plants. Your body can absorb heme iron more readily.Sex and age influence your needsIron needs vary depending on sex and age.Infants and children (to age 13)Boys and girls iron needs from infancy and into late childhood are identical. This is because menstruation does not typically begin before age 13 (3).Newborn babies need the least amount of iron from their diet. Theyre born with a store of iron, absorbed from their mothers blood while in the womb. The Adequate Intake (AI) for infants from birth and up to the first 6 months is 0.27 mg daily. The AI is simply an average of what is normally consumed by healthy, breastfed infants. Thus, their needs are met through breastfeeding alone or from formula (4). Babies who spent less time in the womb, such as premature babies, need more iron than full-term infants. The same holds true for babies with low bi', '-heme iron from fruits, vegetables, beans, and other plant foods as easily as it absorbs heme iron. That means those who eat little or no meat must take in more iron from leafy greens, legumes, whole grains, mushrooms, and other iron-rich plant foods. They also need to get enough vitamin C, which helps the body absorb iron from food.The USDA recommends that women between the ages of 19 and 50 get 18 mg of iron a day, while women ages 51 and older and men 19 years and beyond need 8 mg a day. Moderate amounts of meat plus fruits and vegetables can provide that amount, helped along by the many foods fortified with iron and other vitamins and minerals, like milk, flour, and breakfast cereals. And half of all Americans get some iron from a daily multivitamin.One caution about iron: If you don\' think you are getting enough iron, or feel pooped out and assume it\'s your "tired blood," you may be tempted to pop an iron supplement as insurance. But beware. The body does not excrete iron rapidly. That means it can build up over time and, in some people, becomes toxic. The genetic disorder hemochromatosis causes iron to build up in organs, causing heart failure and diabetes.So don\'t just prescribe yourself an iron supplement on a whim; ask your doctor if you need it.Good sources of ironFoodPortionIron content (milligrams) Disclaimer: As a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.

BBC Future presents a four-minute animated guide to one of the greatest questions weve tried to solve.You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big space is,said the author Douglas Adams. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.

But in 1929 astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the Universe isnt static but is in fact expanding. If so, some scientists reasoned that if you rewound the Universe's life then at some point it should have existed as a tiny, dense point. Critics dismissed this: the celebrated astronomer Fred Hoyle sarcastically called this concept the Big Bang theory, a phrase that would later be adopted by its proponents.Undeterred by sceptics, scientists Ralph Alpher, George Gamow and Robert Herman predicted that if there had been a Big Bang, then a faint afterglow should linger somewhere in the Universe, and we should in theory be able to detect it. To do so would require one of the greatest pieces of fortune in science.In the mid-1960s Astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were having a tough time trying to tune into the microwave signals transmitted from the Milky Way. The radio antenna they were using kept picking up a persistent weak hiss of radio noise. Rebuilding the antenna couldnt get rid of the noise. Nor could clearing the pigeons that had roosted in there, or their mess. Thats because the hiss they tried so hard to remove was the echo of the Big Bang, or the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation as it is known. If the Big Bang theory is true, how did it lead to all the planets, stars and galaxies we can see today? Thanks to a series of calculations, observations from telescopes on Earth and probes in space, our best explanation is this.Around 13.8 billion years ago, all the matter in the Universe emerged from a single, minute point, or singularity, in a violent burst. This expanded at an astonishingly high rate and temperature, doubling in size every 10-34 seconds, creating space as it rapidly inflated.

For centuries scientists thought the Universe always existed in a largely unchanged form, run like clockwork thanks to the laws of physics. But a Belgian priest and scientist called George Lemaitre put forward another idea. In 1927, he proposed that the Universe began as a large, pregnant and primeval atom, exploding and sending out the smaller atoms that we see today.His idea went largely unnoticed. But in 1929 astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the Universe isnt static but is in fact expanding. If so, some scientists reasoned that if you rewound the Universe's life then at some point it should have existed as a tiny, dense point. Critics dismissed this: the celebrated astronomer Fred Hoyle sarcastically called this concept the Big Bang theory, a phrase that would later be adopted by its proponents.Undeterred by sceptics, scientists Ralph Alpher, George Gamow and Robert Herman predicted that if there had been a Big Bang, then a faint afterglow should linger somewhere in the Universe, and we should in theory be able to detect it. To do so would require one of the greatest pieces of fortune in science.In the mid-1960s Astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were having a tough time trying to tune into the microwave signals transmitted from the Milky Way. The radio antenna they were using kept picking up a persistent weak hiss of radio noise. Rebuilding the antenna couldnt get rid of the noise. Nor could clearing the pigeons that had roosted in there, or their mess. Thats because the hiss they tried so hard to remove was the echo of the Big Bang, or the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation as it is known. If the Big Bang theory is true, how did it lead to all the planets, stars and galaxies we can see today? Thanks to a series of calculations, observations from telescopes on Earth and probes in space, our best explanation is this.Around 13.8 billion years ago, all the matter in the Universe emerged from a single, minute point, or singularity, in a violent burst. This expanded at an astonishingly high rate and temperature, doubling in size every 10-34 seconds, creating space as it rapidly inflated. Within a tiny fraction of a second gravity and all the other forces were formed. Energy changed into particles of matter and antimatter, which largely destroyed each other. But luckily for us some matter survived.

AnimalsPropylene glycol is an approved food additive for dog and sugar glider food under the category of animal feed and is generally recognized as safe for dogs,[63] with an LD50 of 9 mL/kg. The LD50 is higher for most laboratory animals (20 mL/kg).[64] However, it is prohibited for use in food for cats due to links to Heinz body formation and a reduced lifespan of red blood cells.[65] Heinz body formation from MPG has not been observed in dogs, cattle, or humans. PG has been used in the dairy industry since the 1950s for cows showing signs of ketosis. The negative energy balance during the early stages of lactation can cause the animal\'s body to have lower glucose levels, inducing the liver to make up for this by the conversion of body fat, leading to several health conditions, e.g. displaced abomasum.[66] PG "reduces the propionate ratio of acetate to acetaminophen, while increasing conversion of ruminal PG to propionate, and aid[s] in the closure of energy deficit in cattle."[66] Allergic reactionEstimates on the prevalence of propylene glycol allergy range from 0.8% (10% propylene glycol in aqueous solution) to 3.5% (30% propylene glycol in aqueous solution).[67][68][69] The North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) data from 1996 to 2006 showed that the most common site for propylene glycol contact dermatitis was the face (25.9%), followed by a generalized or scattered pattern (23.7%).[67] Investigators believe that the incidence of allergic contact dermatitis to propylene glycol may be greater than 2% in patients with eczema or fungal infections, which are very common in countries with lesser sun exposure and lower-than-normal vitamin D balances. Therefore, propylene glycol allergy is more common in those countries.[70] Because of its potential for allergic reactions and frequent use across a variety of topical and systemic products, propylene glycol was named the American Contact Dermatitis Society\'s Allergen of the Year for 2018.[71][72] Recent publication from The Mayo Clinic reported 0.85% incidence of positive patch tests to propylene glycol (100/11,738 patients) with an overall irritant rate of 0.35% (41/11,738 patients) during a 20-year period of 19972016.[73] 87% of the reactions were classified as weak and 9% as strong.

But recent observations of distant supernovae and other observations show that the Universe is not only expanding, but the expansion is accelerating. This astonishing discovery came as a complete surprise because the expansion of the Universe should slow down with time because of the gravitational attraction between galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The unseen repellant force required to explain this observation has been labelled dark energy, and current models say it makes up about 68% of the Universe.That leaves only 5% of the Universe that is visible to us. Supernova 1994D in this image from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope might look like a star, but it's the explosion of a white dwarf that nearly outshone an entire galaxy. Such supernovas  known as type Ia  are extremely similar to each other, allowing astronomers to use them to measure the rate of the expansion of the universe. What We Know and What We ThinkWhile we cant see dark matter, we know its there. And we can investigate some of dark matters properties using gravitational lensing. This technique measures the gravitational pull galaxies exert on light from more distant sources. The warping and magnification of this light gives us insight into the amount, density, and distribution of dark matter in any given lensing galaxy. Theoretically, the current best explanation we have for dark matter is the existence of WIMPs, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. These theoretical particles should have certain predictable behaviors, but directly observing them and their byproducts so far has proved elusive.As for dark energy, Einstein had assumed the Universe was static, neither expanding nor collapsing. However, his Theory of General Relativity predicted that the Universe was not static, and so he added a cosmological constant, to oppose gravity. He later called it the biggest blunder of his life after Hubble demonstrated that the Universe was expanding.The discovery that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating revived the idea of the cosmological constant. The simplest interpretation of this constant is that it represents the energy of empty space.

Share Content on Facebook Share Content on LinkedIn Share Content on Flipboard Share Content on Reddit Share Content via Email The Earth, our celestial home, is in perpetual motion, gracefully rotating through space. This continuous rotation gives us the cycle of day and night, shapes our seasons, and influences our climate. Over geological time spans, it's gradually slowing down, which has led to speculation about what would happen if the Earth stopped rotating altogether.Let's take a closer look at this hypothetical scenario and explore the profound consequences of a motionless Earth, where the climate would shift dramatically and you could say  literally  the Earth stood still.AdvertisementContents Why Does Earth Spin? How Fast Does Earth Spin? What Would Happen if Earth Suddenly Stopped Rotating? Is Earth's Rotation Slowing Down? Sources Why Does Earth Spin? You have to admit, it doesn't feel like you're spinning around the center of the Earth at hundreds of miles an hour, so it's not hard to cut our scientific forebears some slack for assuming the planet was stationary and that the sun rotated around it.Thankfully, Copernicus set the record straight with his heliocentric model, and we now know that the Earth spins on its axis as it revolves around the sun. But why does our planet spin in the first place?AdvertisementRemember Newton's first law of motion? It states that an object remains in whatever state of motion it's in  unless another force acts upon it. Basically, the Earth is rotating because it's been doing that as long as it has existed.Before there were planets in our solar system, there was a spinning, nebulous cloud of dust with our sun at the center. Over time, these dust particles collided into one another and began to stick, forming larger and larger rocks and, ultimately, planets through a process known as accretion.But remember, the cloud of dust  or accretion disc  was rotating f", "D modelsFree DownloadsOnline 3D3D PrintingImagesVideosAnimationsOnline 3D3D PrintingImagesVideosAnimationsPhysics mysteriesLog-inCreate new accountPhysics mysteriesWhat would happen if the Earth stopped rotating?Jaroslav Kores, Ph.D.That would probably be pretty unpleasant, Im afraid it would almost immediately end all life on the Earth.The Earth rotates with a frequency of 1 rotation per 24 hours. By a fairly simple calculation, we can find out that at the equator, its speed is over 1,600 km/h (the closer to the poles, the slower the rotation speed).Since the law of inertia applies always and everywhere, what would happen would be that all things at rest relative to the Earth would continue to move at 1,600 km/h in the direction of the Earths rotation.So all the houses/towers/trees/rocks would be torn off the surface, water would pour out of the rivers and seas, dust would rise and people, cars or animals would fly in all of it.To prove the effect of a speed of 1,600 km/h, we can look at the Beaufort wind scale  it ends at a hurricane, which has a speed of about 120 km/h and more.So the strongest wind that destroys houses is 13 times weaker than what the wind speed would be if the Earth stopped rotating.I can not fully believe that we would be able to hide somewhere  everything on the surface would be destroyed, it would probably be quite difficult to get out of the underground (I would not expect that the entrance to the bunker would remain freely accessible).But even if we got outside, it would take many years for the dust to fall back to the ground and therefore the Suns rays would not reach the surface, which would cause both great cooling and the extermination of plants.Without plants there would be no photosynthesis and without it there would be no oxygen, which is a vital element for the survival of animals.So we would creep into an extremely cold environment in which we would not be able to breathe and would not even provide us with any food.It would be best if we started each morning by saying that we are glad that the Earth is rotating and we hope that it will continue to do so.Want to ask something?Send us an e-mail with the subject Physics mysteries to the address:We can't wait to tackle your interesting questions!EASY LINKSLearningOnline 3D ModelsFree DownloadsGlossaryPhysics mysteriesABOUT USEnergy encyclopedia (EE) is the project of Simopt.

IQ Air, which measures pollution in 109 countries around the globe, considers measurements above 35.5 to be unhealthy for sensitive groups, levels between 55.5 and 150.4 to be unhealthy for all, and anything higher is either very unhealthy (150.5-250.4) or hazardous (250.5 or higher).Top 10 Countries with the Worst Air Pollution - PM2.5 exposure (g/m) - 2022While the IQ Air list is respectable, it is not the only available source of air pollution data. Using data from Seattle, Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the Health Effects Institute has released its own list ranking the levels of air pollution of 196 nations via the State of Global Air report.The Air Quality Index (AQI) used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency is slightly more lenient than the IQ Air scale (by about 50 g/m). Values of 0-100 are generally thought of as satisfactory. However, values from 101-200 are considered unhealthy for certain at-risk groups, values 201-300 are viewed as unhealthy for everyone, and levels above 300 are deemed hazardous for all.The cleanest countries in the world, as determined by the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), have high air quality, clean water, and strong environmentally-friendly policies and initiatives. These countries include Switzerland, France, and Denmark.As the damage from pollution has become more apparent, more countries are looking to green alternatives to prevent further damage to the Earth.

Chad's capital, N'Djamena, frequently grapples with dust storms that blanket the city. The country's increasing reliance on biomass as a primary energy source for cooking and heating continues to raise indoor pollution, with dire health implications for its population, particularly affecting vulnerable groups like children and women.2. IraqIraq's pollution has taken a sharp upward trajectory, moving from a PM2.5 concentration of 39.6 in 2019 to a startling 80.1 in 2022. This alarming rise points to escalating environmental challenges stemming from industrial growth, traffic congestion, and recurrent dust storms. The ongoing conflict makes the situation worse, damaging infrastructure and raising dust levels. Such urban centers as Baghdad are particularly affected, with residents facing the brunt of pollution from traffic and industrial activities, including significant contributions from the oil sector's gas flaring practices.3. PakistanPakistan's air quality saga is marked by fluctuations, with the PM2.5 concentration peaking at 74.3 in 2018, dipping to 59 in 2020, and climbing back to 70.9 in 2022. This seesaw pattern reflects the ongoing struggle against such air pollution sources as vehicle emissions, industrial discharges, and agricultural burning. Urban areas, notably Lahore and Karachi, are hotspots for hazardous air, impacting millions. The government's efforts to curb pollution face the uphill task of balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability. The Pakistan minister for climate change blamed India for Pakistan's smog; however, Pakistani citizens blame their government for simply not doing enough to monitor or combat the crisis.4. BahrainBahrain's journey through the pollution scale reveals a complex pattern, with a PM2.5 concentration that fluctuated from 59.8 in 2018, reduced to 39.7 in 2020, and then spiked to 66.6 in 2022. These fluctuations reflect the challenges posed by industrial emissions, heavy traffic, and regional dust storms.

When two or more independent variables are used to predict or explain the outcome of the dependent variable, this is known as multiple regression.Regression analysis can be used for three things:Forecasting the effects or impact of specific changes. For example, if a manufacturing company wants to forecast how many units of a particular product they need to produce in order to meet the current demand.Forecasting the effects or impact of specific changesForecasting trends and future values. For example, how much will the stock price of Lufthansa be in 6 months from now?Forecasting trends and future values.Determining the strength of different predictorsor, in other words, assessing how much of an impact the independent variable(s) has on a dependent variable. For example, if a soft drinks company is sponsoring a football match, they might want to determine if the ads being displayed during the match have accounted for any increase in sales.Determining the strength of different predictorsRegression analysis can be broadly classified into two types: Linear regression and logistic regression.Linear regressionlogistic regressionIn statistics, linear regression is usually used for predictive analysis. It essentially determines the extent to which there is a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In terms of output, linear regression will give you a trend line plotted amongst a set of data points. You might use linear regression if you wanted to predict the sales of a company based on the cost spent on online advertisements, or if you wanted to see how the change in the GDP might affect the stock price of a company.The second type of regression analysis is logistic regression, and thats what well be focusing on in this post. Logistic regression is essentially used to calculate (or predict) the probability of a binary (yes/no) event occurring. Well explain what exactly logistic regression is and how its used in the next section.2. What is logistic regression?Logistic regression is a classification algorithm. It is used to predict a binary outcome based on a set of independent variables.Ok, so what does this mean? A binary outcome is one where there are only two possible scenarioseither the event happens (1) or it does not happen (0). Independent variables are those variables or factors which may influence the outcome (or dependent variable).binary outcomeIndependent variablesSo: Logistic', 'TeamsTeamsQ&A for workConnect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search.linear regression with 3-dimensional pointsI\'ve been hunting around looking for a way to do this problem. I need to create a program to calculate linear regression for 100 3-dimensional points. I also have the matching outcomes of the points, so it\'s like a training set rather than a testing set. I\'m also instructed to consider the bias term, but I\'m not sure what that means.I can find good documentation for 2-dimensional points, but not for 3 dimensions. Since there\'s so many equations for doing XY data points, surely there\'s a similar equation set for XYZ points. I\'m not really desiring to be given the equation outright, but more interested in an understanding of the function and how it works, as well as how it\'s determined.

The integers are converted into binary format and then operations are performed bit by bit, hence the name bitwise operators. Python bitwise operators work on integers only and the final output is returned in the decimal format. Python bitwise operators are also called binary operators.Python Bitwise OperatorsThere are 6 bitwise operators in Python. The below table provides short details about them.Lets look into these operators one by one and understand how they work.1. Bitwise AND OperatorPython bitwise and operator returns 1 if both the bits are 1, otherwise 0.2. Bitwise OR OperatorPython bitwise or operator returns 1 if any of the bits is 1. If both the bits are 0, then it returns 0.3. Bitwise XOR OperatorPython bitwise XOR operator returns 1 if one of the bits is 0 and the other bit is 1. If both the bits are 0 or 1, then it returns 0.4. Bitwise Ones Complement OperatorPython Ones complement of a number A is equal to -(A+1).5. Bitwise Left Shift OperatorPython bitwise left shift operator shifts the left operand bits towards the left side for the given number of times in the right operand. In simple terms, the binary number is appended with 0s at the end.6. Bitwise Right Shift OperatorPython right shift operator is exactly the opposite of the left shift operator. Then left side operand bits are moved towards the right side for the given number of times. In simple terms, the right side bits are removed.Python Bitwise Operator OverloadingPython supports operator overloading.

2024_10_24 Model Response: In Python, Python bitwise operators are employed for performing binary calculations on integers. These operations are executed bit by bit, resulting in the term "bitwise operator" being used to describe them. There exist six such operators within the language. Here is a brief overview of each of them:

1. Bitwise AND: When both the bits are 1, the operator returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
2.Bitwise OR: If a bit is 1 and the other is 0, then the binary operator will return 1. However, if the bit and operator are both 0 and 1 respectively, this will result in a return of 0.
3. Binomial Operations: The binary number is appended with 0s at the end. This is known as the "binomial operation."
4. One of the Python ones' complement of a number A is equal to -(A+1)

Each object has its pattern and that is what the computer will use to identify an object in an image.To explain convolutional neural networks in simple terms - just as parents train their children, computers are also trained by showing a million images of the same object so that their ability to recognize that object increases with each sample.The true catching-on of CNNs came with Alex Krizhevsky winning 2012's ImageNet competition wherein he used the networks to reduce the image classification errors from 26% to 15%. This substantial drop was considered a turning point in the history of digital image classification. Since then, several digital giants have used CNNs in functionalities that will help their businesses grow, such as Google, Amazon, Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest.Structure of CNNsCNNs are structured differently as compared to a regular neural network. In a regular neural network, each layer consists of a set of neurons. Each layer is connected to all neurons in the previous layer. The way convolutional neural networks work is that they have 3-dimensional layers in a width, height, and depth manner. All neurons in a particular layer are not connected to the neurons in the previous layer. Instead, a layer is only connected to a small portion of neurons in the previous layer.Let's start with the top layer - The Math Layer The top layer is perceived as the mathematical layer. It is essentially the convolutional layer and deals with understanding the number pattern it sees. Let's assume the first position in this layer starts applying a filter around the top left corner of the image. The filter is also referred to as a neuron or a kernel. It reads that part of the image and forms a conclusion of an array of numbers, multiplies the array, and deduces a single number out of this process. This single number represents the top left corner that the convolutional layer has just read of the image. The part of the image that the filter scans over is the receptive field. The filter then moves right by 1 unit and starts the same process again. In this fashion, the convolutional layer reads the entire image and assigns a single number to each unit. This data gets stored in a 3D array. In essentiality, this entire process functions like the human brain. What we are referring to as the receptive field in the world of CNNs is the visual field in the world of human biology. The filter ", 'ework for a particular task from different frameworks available. Click to explore Virtual Network FunctionsWhat is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple input and output layers, mainly used for computer vision.According to Wikipedia In mathematics, convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions that produces a third function that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other. The term convolution refers to both the result function and the computing process. This concept breaks the image into multiple parts and analyzes them independently.CNN is a layers-based system, and the different layers have different mathematical compositions. The main types of layers are convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.Convolutional layers are the features in an input image in a summarized view. At this stage, different mathematical operations work, and the output for the image pixels gets stored in the grid format, called a kernel. The output of this layer is location sensitive.A pooling layer is an approach with a down-sampling feature in patches. An optimizable feature extractor is work at each image position to make it highly efficient. Two common pooling methods are average pooling(the average) and max pooling(most activated).Finally, the fully connected layer combines the previous layer\'s output and predicts the best possible results.In this layer system, one layer\'s output is input for the other layer, and the complexity increases layer by layer.What are the different types of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architectures?The various types of CNN Architectures are listed below:LeNetLeNet is among the first successful CNN projects. This method is also recommended to beginners as the "Hello World" code. In 1998 the first use case for this deep learning technique was used to recognize handwritten digits. This model includes five convolution layers and two fully connected layers. Due to the vanishing gradients, the training was not easy for this model, which was later compensated with "Max-pooling" as a connection layer between convolutional layers. This made the training easy by preventing overfitting.AlexNet (Ilsvrc 2012 winner)The concept of "Max-pooling" was accepted to the extent that this new AlexNet network combines 5 max-pooling layers,3 fully connected and two dropouts.Though this architecture is quite similar to LeNet, but much deeper stacked layers.

Mercury Commented Aug 19, 2020 at 19:51 2 Answers 2 Configures the model for training. documentationPersonally, I wouldn't call it compile, because what it does has got nothing to do with compilation, in computer science terms, and this is very confusing/ overwhelming to think about machine learning and compilation at the same time.Its just a method which does configuration:It just sets the arguments you pass it: optimizer, loss function, metrics, eager execution. You can run it multiple times, it will just overwrite the settings you set previously.My suggestion to developers of TensorFlow would be to rename it to configure in the short term, and perhaps in the future (not that important), move to having 1 setter (or use the factory/ builder pattern) for each configuration argument.Heres the code for it:model.compile is related to training your model. Actually, your weights need to optimize and this function can optimize them. In a way that your accuracy make increases. This was just one of the input parameters called 'optimizer'.These are the main inputs. Also you can find more details in TensorFlow documentation in link bel", 'model or a subclassed model as well):Here\'s what the typical end-to-end workflow looks like, consisting of:TrainingValidation on a holdout set generated from the original training dataEvaluation on the test dataWe\'ll use MNIST data for this example.We specify the training configuration (optimizer, loss, metrics):We call fit(), which will train the model by slicing the data into "batches" of size batch_size, and repeatedly iterating over the entire dataset for a given number of epochs.The returned history object holds a record of the loss values and metric values during training:We evaluate the model on the test data via evaluate():Now, let\'s review each piece of this workflow in detail.The compile() method: specifying a loss, metrics, and an optimizerTo train a model with fit(), you need to specify a loss function, an optimizer, and optionally, some metrics to monitor.You pass these to the model as arguments to the compile() method:The metrics argument should be a list -- your model can have any number of metrics.If your model has multiple outputs, you can specify different losses and metrics for each output, and you can modulate the contribution of each output to the total loss of the model. You will find more details about this in the Passing data to multi-input, multi-output models section.Passing data to multi-input, multi-output modelsNote that if you\'re satisfied with the default settings, in many cases the optimizer, loss, and metrics can be specified via string identifiers as a shortcut:For later reuse, let\'s put our model definition and compile step in functions; we will call them several times across different examples in this guide.Many built-in optimizers, losses, and metrics are availableIn general, you won\'t have to create your own losses, metrics, or optimizers from scratch, because what you need is likely to be already part of the Keras API:Optimizers:SGD() (with or without momentum)RMSprop()Adam()etc.Losses:MeanSquaredError()KLDivergence()CosineSimilarity()etc.Metrics:AUC()Precision()Recall()etc.Custom lossesIf you need to create a custom loss, Keras provides three ways to do so.The first method involves creating a function that accepts inputs y_true and y_pred.

Answer: In TensorFlow, "logits" refer to the raw, unnormalized predictions generated by the last layer of a neural network before applying an activation function, often used in classification tasks.logitsIn TensorFlow, logits represent the raw, unnormalized predictions generated by the output layer of a neural network before applying an activation function. Essentially, logits are the scores assigned to each class or category, reflecting the model\'s confidence in its predictions.Purpose and Significance:Logits serve as crucial intermediates in the classification process. They provide a numeric representation of the model\'s belief in the presence of each class, enabling further processing to derive meaningful predictions. These raw scores are essential for various tasks, including multi-class classification, where the model needs to distinguish between multiple categories.Transformation with Softmax:Following the computation of logits, a common practice is to apply the softmax activation function. Softmax transforms the logits into probabilities, ensuring that the output values lie within the range of [0, 1] and sum up to one. This normalization process allows for easier interpretation of the model\'s predictions, as the resulting probabilities represent the likelihood of each class.Training and Optimization:During the training phase, the model learns to adjust its parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the disparity between the predicted probabilities (obtained after softmax transformation) and the actual labels. This process involves optimizing a chosen loss function, which typically quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted and true values. By iteratively updating the parameters through techniques like gr', "g probabilities represent the likelihood of each class.Training and Optimization:During the training phase, the model learns to adjust its parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the disparity between the predicted probabilities (obtained after softmax transformation) and the actual labels. This process involves optimizing a chosen loss function, which typically quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted and true values. By iteratively updating the parameters through techniques like gradient descent optimization, the model endeavors to improve its predictive accuracy.Interpretation and Application:Once the logits are transformed into probabilities, they become interpretable as the likelihood of each class. This enables users to make informed decisions based on the model's predictions, such as classifying input data into different categories or making probabilistic assessments.Conclusion:In TensorFlow, logits serve as fundamental components in the classification pipeline, representing the raw predictions generated by a neural network before undergoing further processing. Understanding the concept of logits is crucial for effectively utilizing TensorFlow's capabilities in various machine-learning tasks, from image classification to natural language processing. By grasping the significance of logits, practitioners can harness the power of TensorFlow to build robust and accurate predictive models.ASimilar Reads Data Science AI-ML-DS Data Science Questions Tensorflow Please Login to comment...What kind of Experience do you want to share?"]], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.45625150969709666, 0.7515122796939097]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}

The next example shows how we can generate equivalent equations by first simplifying one or both members of an equation.Example 2 Write an equation equivalent to4x- 2-3x = 4 + 6by combining like terms and then by adding 2 to each member.Combining like terms yieldsx - 2 = 10Adding 2 to each member yieldsx-2+2 =10+2x = 12To solve an equation, we use the addition-subtraction property to transform a given equation to an equivalent equation of the form x = a, from which we can find the solution by inspection.Example 3 Solve 2x + 1 = x - 2.We want to obtain an equivalent equation in which all terms containing x are in one member and all terms not containing x are in the other. If we first add -1 to (or subtract 1 from) each member, we get2x + 1- 1 = x - 2- 12x = x - 3If we now add -x to (or subtract x from) each member, we get2x-x = x - 3 - xx = -3where the solution -3 is obvious.The solution of the original equation is the number -3; however, the answer is often displayed in the form of the equation x = -3.Since each equation obtained in the process is equivalent to the original equation, -3 is also a solution of 2x + 1 = x - 2. In the above example, we can check the solution by substituting - 3 for x in the original equation2(-3) + 1 = (-3) - 2-5 = -5The symmetric property of equality is also helpful in the solution of equations. This property statesIf a = b then b = aThis enables us to interchange the members of an equation whenever we please without having to be concerned with any changes of sign. Thus,If 4 = x + 2 then x + 2 = 4If x + 3 = 2x - 5 then 2x - 5 = x + 3If d = rt then rt = dThere may be several different ways to apply the addition property above. Sometimes one method is better than another, and in some cases, the symmetric property of equality is also helpful.Example 4 Solve 2x = 3x - 9. (1)Solution ', 'he left-hand member of the equation; those to the right make up the right-hand member. Thus, in the equation x + 3 = 7, the left-hand member is x + 3 and the right-hand member is 7.SOLVING EQUATIONSEquations may be true or false, just as word sentences may be true or false. The equation:3 + x = 7will be false if any number except 4 is substituted for the variable. The value of the variable for which the equation is true (4 in this example) is called the solution of the equation. We can determine whether or not a given number is a solution of a given equation by substituting the number in place of the variable and determining the truth or falsity of the result.Example 1 Determine if the value 3 is a solution of the equation4x - 2 = 3x + 1Solution We substitute the value 3 for x in the equation and see if the left-hand member equals the right-hand member.4(3) - 2 = 3(3) + 112 - 2 = 9 + 110 = 10Ans. 3 is a solution.The first-degree equations that we consider in this chapter have at most one solution. The solutions to many such equations can be determined by inspection.Example 2 Find the solution of each equation by inspection.a. x + 5 = 12 b. 4  x = -20Solutions a. 7 is the solution since 7 + 5 = 12. b. -5 is the solution since 4(-5) = -20.SOLVING EQUATIONS USING ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION PROPERTIESIn Section 3.1 we solved some simple first-degree equations by inspection. However, the solutions of most equations are not immediately evident by inspection. Hence, we need some mathematical "tools" for solving equations.EQUIVALENT EQUATIONSEquivalent equations are equations that have identical solutions. Thus,3x + 3 = x + 13, 3x = x + 10, 2x = 10, and x = 5are equivalent equations, because 5 is the only solution of each of them. Notice in the equation 3x + 3 = x + 13, the solution 5 is not evident by inspection but in the equation x = 5, the solution 5 is evident by inspection. In solving any equation, we transform a given equation whose solution may not be obvious to an equivalent equation whose solution is easily noted.The following property, sometimes called the addition-subtraction property, is one way that we can generate equivalent equations.If the same quantity is added to or subtracted from both members of an equation, the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation.In symbols,a - b, a + c = b + c, and a - c = b - care equivalent equations.Example 1 Write an equation equivalent tox + 3 = 7by subtracting 3 from each member.Solution Subtractin']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[1.336338081891681, 1.3726471489013314]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}
2024_10_26 Model Response: The property known as the addition-subtraction property allows us to derive equivalent equations when the same quantity is added or subtracted from both members of an equation. This property can be expressed using symbols such as a - b, a + c = b+ c, and a-c=b - care equivalent expressions. To accomplish this task, we need to simplify one or both elements of the equation by combining like terms and then adding 2 to each member.

Additionally, theres no user-management system available and a proprietary desktop GUI.GitHub, meanwhile, lives in the cloud, so Internet access is required. It also has a built-in user-management system and a user-friendly GUI. In addition to its main website, GitHub features a desktop version that can be installed on local computers to help synchronize code.

Maybe you think it\'s dynamically typed. Maybe you think, hmm, this is a talk about \'Static Typing in Python\', so it\'s probably statically typed? Or maybe you think this is a trick question? Yeah, it\'s a trick question. The answer is that Python is dynamically typed, but it can optionally be as statically typed as you want it to be. And if that doesn\'t make any sense to you, that\'s OK, you\'re in the right talk, and we\'ll break down everything that\'s necessary to understand that answer. To understand that, we need to understand types in Python, and type systems in general. We\'ll talk about dynamic typing in Python, then we\'ll talk about static typing in Python. Once we understand that, we\'ll talk about how to use static typing in Python, when you should use it, and when you maybe shouldn\'t use it as well. Let\'s talk about types, and specifically let\'s talk about type, the builtin keyword in Python. In Python, in our REPL, we can type something like this: type(42), and we get back something that says it\'s of the class int. Since forty-two is an integer, this makes sense. We can do the same thing for floats... ...strings... ...lists, etc. The type builtin tells us what type a given object is. You might say, "oh, I recognize these things, str, int, float, this is what I use to change one type into another." And yeah, you could have a variable like this, a = 42... ...you call float() on it and you get a float... ...you call str() on it and you get a string... ...and you can call list() on it and you get a really ugly list. Who\'s seen a really ugly list like this before, where a string is getting turned into a list? That\'s a type error! You\'ve had a type error in your code, where something that was expecting an iterable, like a list, and got a string instead, and Python did this. The thing to note here is that things like int look like all the types available t', 't". Adding type annotations to Python does not make it statically typed, but using those type annotations with a static type checker such as MyPy does make the resulting combination of Python+MyPy one.  Jrg W Mittag Commented Dec 7, 2023 at 11:20 12 immediately. static typing is always best - softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/59606/).  Ewan Commented Dec 7, 2023 at 15:45 12 Possibly even at the beginning. Someone learning programming for the first time can stand to benefit from getting immediate feedback on type errors as they write their code, rather than finding out at run time.  Nayuki Commented Dec 7, 2023 at 21:27 9 Answers 9 What can they do that even the addition of type in dynamically typed languages can\'t do?TL;DR - Static Analysis (including the standard checks the compiler does).As the toolchain / editors get better this becomes more of question of degree rather than a yes/no factor.In that we are seeing more static analysis performed by editors and tooling for dynamically typed languages - however if type hinting is optional and/or some automatic casting is performed at runtime the static analysis has to allow for that and may not find as many problems as it is possible to find in a static and strongly typed language. Further other features of the language can be checked statically for example it is possible to check for private methods - again this isn\'t exclusive to statically typed languages however dynamic languages have more flexibility in this area and if a language provides a mechanism to override the method protections the static analysis can\'t generate a hard error for this violation.In short static typing is a set of hard rules, if you make the rules "harder" for dynamically typed languages you can get closer to the benefits of statically typed languages, but at some point you create a statically typed language.Another thing to note is that on the "edge" of our software (even that written in strongly+statically typed languages) we tend to switch to more loose typing:A lot of code is written without static analysis of SQL statements / SQLs that are built dynamically.When generating web pages on the server side we often use templating languages.Sometimes we (de)serialize in generic ways for example to JSON. On the other hand, we also sometimes use DSLs to provide even stronger typing than common objects and primitives.  Ahmed Tawfik Commented Dec 8, 2023 at 11:21 2 JSON is a good example.

2024_10_26 Model Response: To begin with, let us delve into the topic of Static Typing in Python. While some may argue that Python is dynamically typed, it's important to note that this is not the case. Rather, Python allows you to opt for either statically or dynamically-typed types depending on your preference. To comprehend the nuances of Python's type system, you need to delve deeper into its built-in keyword. For instance, in our REPL, we can use type(42) to create something of the class int. Since forty-two is an integer, this makes sense. We can do the same thing for floats......strings......lists, etc. The type builtin tells us what type a given object is. You might say, "Oh, I recognize these things, str, int, float,... This is what I use to change one type into another."

Understanding Time Series A time series can be taken on any variable that changes over time. In investing, it is common to use a time series to track the price of a security over time. This can be tracked over the short term, such as the price of a security on the hour over the course of a business day, or the long term, such as the price of a security at close on the last day of every month over the course of five years. Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, security, or economic variable changes over time. It also can be used to examine how the changes associated with the chosen data point compare to shifts in other variables over the same time period. Time series is also used in several non', 'sales, and decrease costs.

2024_10_26 Recorded Text: Hello Sky, what is the difference between RAM and sequential memory?
2024_10_26 Context(Action): {'ids': [['403709411.08', '6134043991.14']], 'embeddings': None, 'documents': [["ory.RAM vs. virtual memoryA computer can run short on main memory, especially when running multiple programs simultaneously. Operating systems can compensate for physical memory shortfalls by creating virtual memory.With virtual memory, the system temporarily transfers data from RAM to secondary storage and increases the virtual address space. This is accomplished by using active memory in RAM and inactive memory in the secondary storage to form a contiguous address space that can hold an application and its data.With virtual memory, a system can load larger programs or multiple programs running at the same time, letting each operate as if it has infinite memory without having to add more RAM. Virtual memory can handle twice as many addresses as RAM. A program's instructions and data are initially stored at virtual addresses. When the program is executed, those addresses are translated to actual memory addresses.One downside to virtual memory is that it can cause a computer to operate slowly because data must be mapped between the virtual and physical memory. With physical memory alone, programs work directly from RAM.RAM vs. flash memoryFlash memory and RAM are both made up of solid-state chips. However, the two memory types play different roles in computer systems because of differences in how they're made and perform, as well as their cost.Flash memory is used to store data. RAM receives the data from the flash SSD and provides it to the processor (via the cache). In this way, the processor has the data it needs much more quickly than if it were retrieving the data directly from the SSDs.One significant difference between RAM and flash memory is that data must be erased from NAND flash memory in entire blocks. This makes it slower than RAM, where data can be erased in individual bits. However, NAND flash memory is less expensive than RAM and is non-volatile, which means it can hold data even when the power is off, unlike RAM.RAM vs. ROMRead-only memory, or ROM, is computer memory containing data that can only be read, not written to (except for the initial writing). ROM chips are often used to store startup code that runs each time a computer is turned on. The data generally can't be altered or reprogrammed.The data in ROM is non-volatile, so it isn't lost when the computer power is turned off. As a result, ROM can be used for permanent data storage. RAM, on the other hand, can hold data only temporarily. A computer's ROM chip generally holds only sever", 'ic and dynamic RAM are considered volatile, as their state is lost or reset when power is removed from the system. By contrast, read-only memory (ROM) stores data by permanently enabling or disabling selected transistors, such that the memory cannot be altered. Writable variants of ROM (such as EEPROM and NOR flash) share properties of both ROM and RAM, enabling data to persist without power and to be updated without requiring special equipment. ECC memory (which can be either SRAM or DRAM) includes special circuitry to detect and/or correct random faults (memory errors) in the stored data, using parity bits or error correction codes. In general, the term RAM refers solely to solid-state memory devices (either DRAM or SRAM), and more specifically the main memory in most computers. In optical storage, the term DVD-RAM is somewhat of a misnomer since, it is not random access; it behaves much like a hard disc drive if somewhat slower. Aside, unlike CD-RW or DVD-RW, DVD-RAM does not need to be erased before reuse. Memory cellThe memory cell is the fundamental building block of computer memory. The memory cell is an electronic circuit that stores one bit of binary information and it must be set to store a logic 1 (high voltage level) and reset to store a logic 0 (low voltage level). Its value is maintained/stored until it is changed by the set/reset process. The value in the memory cell can be accessed by reading it. In SRAM, the memory cell is a type of flip-flop circuit, usually implemented using FETs. This means that SRAM requires very low power when not being accessed, but it is expensive and has low storage density. A second type, DRAM, is based around a capacitor. Charging and discharging this capacitor can store a "1" or a "0" in the cell. However, the charge in this capacitor slowly leaks away, and must be refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh process, DRAM uses more power, but it can achieve greater storage densities and lower unit costs compared to SRAM. AddressingTo be useful, memory cells must be readable and writable. Within the RAM device, multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry is used to select memory cells. Typically, a RAM device has a set of address lines A 0 , A 1 , . . . A n A_0,A_1,...A_n , and for each combination of bits that may be applied to these lines, a set of memory cells are activated. Due to this addressing, RAM devices virtually always have a memory capacity that is a power of two. Usually several memory cells share ']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.7407446406202718, 0.7445862293243408]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}
2024_10_26 Model Response: When running multiple programs at once, a computer may experience a shortage of primary memory. To address this issue, operating systems employ virtual memory, which transfers data from RAM to secondary storage to create a contiguous address space. Virtual memory can handle twice as many addresses as RAM. A program's instructions and data are initially stored at virtual addresses, but when the program is executed, those addresses are translated to actual memory addresses. NAND flash memory is less expensive than RAM and is non-volatile, allowing it to hold data even when power is off. On the other hand, read-only memory (ROM) is computer memory containing data that can only be read, not written to (except for the initial writing). ROM chips are often used to store startup code that runs each time the computer is turned on.

Cambridge IGCSECambridge IGCSE exams are conducted in three sessions: February/March (India only), May/June and October/November, and the results are released in May, August and January respectively. The exams are set by Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE), which is part of Cambridge Assessment that also includes OCR, a UK GCSE examination board. As of January 2021, there are over 70 subjects available and schools can offer them in any combination.[3] The Cambridge examination board offers an ICE (International Certificate in Education) group qualification for candidates who achieve 7 subject passes across the following groups:[4] Group 1: LanguagesGroup 2: Humanities and Social SciencesGroup 3: SciencesGroup 4: MathematicsGroup 5: Creative and Vocational (Professional and Creative)The certificate is awarded to candidat', "st taken in 2017, the IGCSE was often considered to be more similar to the older O-Levels qualification than the current GCSE in England, and for this reason was often argued to be a more rigorous and more difficult examination.[10] Before the early 2010s, most schools offering the IGCSE were private international schools for expatriate children around the world. However, in the 2010s, an increasing number of independent schools within the United Kingdom also began offering IGCSEs as an alternative to conventional English GCSEs for international IGCSE subjects, on the supposed basis that it is more challenging than the national curriculum.[11] A comparison between GCSEs and IGCSEs was conducted by the Department of Education in 2019. The study found that it was easier to achieve a grade A in English Language and English Literature in IGCSEs but harder to achieve a grade A in science subjects. Most other subjects were roughly equivalent.[12] The change from an A*-G grading system to a 9-1 grading system by English GCSE qualifications has led to a 9-1 grade International General Certificate of Secondary Education being made available.[13] Before, this qualification was graded on an 8-point scale from A* to G with a 9th grade U signifying Ungraded. This measure of grading was also found in the UK GCSE. Most IGCSE subjects offer a choice of tiered examinations: Core or Extended papers (in Cambridge International), and Foundation or Higher papers (in Edexcel). This is designed to make IGCSE suitable for students with varying levels of ability. In some subjects, IGCSE can be taken with or without coursework.At one point in time, the A* grade in the GCSE did not exist but was later added to recognise the very top end of achievement. In the case of Further Mathematics, an extra A* grade was added for students that can demonstrate sustained performance in higher-level maths skills such as reasoning, proof and problem-solving.[14] Recognition and equivalenceThe qualification is recognised by many institutions[quantify] in the world.

Duplicate elements are not allowed.A set itself may be modified, but the elements contained in the set must be of an immutable type.Lets see what all that means, and how you can work with sets in Python.A set can be created in two ways. First, you can define a set with the built-in set() function:In this case, the argument <iter> is an iterableagain, for the moment, think list or tuplethat generates the list of objects to be included in the set. This is analogous to the <iter> argument given to the .extend() list method:Strings are also iterable, so a string can be passed to set() as well. You have already seen that list(s) generates a list of the characters in the string s. Similarly, set(s) generates a set of the characters in s:You can see that the resulting sets are unordered: the original order, as specified in the definition, is not necessarily preserved. Additionally, duplicate values are only represented in the set once, as with the string 'foo' in the first two examples and the letter 'u' in the third.Alternately, a set can be defined with curly braces ():When a set is defined this way, each <obj> becomes a distinct element of the set, even if it is an iterable. This behavior is similar to that of the .append() list method.Thus, the sets shown above can also be defined like this:To recap:The argument to set() is an iterable. It generates a list of elements to be placed into the set.The objects in curly braces are placed into the set intact, even if they are iterable.Observe the difference between these two set definitions:A set can be empty. However, recall that Python interprets empty curly braces () as an empty dictionary, so the only way to define an empty set is with the set() function:An empty set is falsy in a Boolean context:You might think the most intuitive sets would contain similar objectsfor example, e", 'Table of ContentsWhat Is a Set?Set ItemsHow to Create a Set in PythonHow to Modify a Set in PythonHow to Get the Length of a SetVarious Set Methods (With Their Uses)Set() Constructor in PythonPython FrozensetSet in Python: Everything You Need to Know About ItTable of ContentsWhat Is a Set?Set ItemsHow to Create a Set in PythonHow to Modify a Set in PythonHow to Get the Length of a SetVarious Set Methods (With Their Uses)Set() Constructor in PythonPython FrozensetPython is undoubtedly one of the most popular languages today, and in this article, you will learn everything about set in python with the help of examples.

It is one of the four built-in data types (List, Dictionary, Tuple, and Set) having qualities and usage different from the other three. It is a collection that is written with curly brackets and is both unindexed and unordered. A set is mutable, i.e., we can remove or add elements to it. Set in python is similar to mathematical sets, and operations like intersection, union, symmetric difference, and more can be applied. Learn the Ins & Outs of Software DevelopmentSet ItemsItems of a set in python are immutable (unchangeable), do not duplicate values, and unordered. Thus, items in a set do not appear in a stipulated manner, i.e., they can appear in a different order every time it is used. Due to this, set items cannot be referred to by key or index. After a set is created, its items cannot be changed. However, new items can be added. As we mentioned, all set items need to be unique because duplicates are not allowed.

If you want to change it, you need to use a list instead of a tuple.Note that you could instead make a new tuple that has the new value as its first element.Frist, ask yourself why you want to mutate your tuple. There is a reason why strings and tuple are immutable in Ptyhon, if you want to mutate your tuple then it should probably be a list instead. There is a reason why strings and tuple are immutable in PtyhonSecond, if you still wish to mutate your tuple then you can convert your tuple to a list then convert it back, and reassign the new tuple to the same variable. This is great if you are only going to mutate your tuple once. Otherwise, I personally think that is counterintuitive. Because It is essentially creating a new tuple and every time if you wish to mutate the tuple you would have to perform the conversion. Also If you read the code it would be confusing to think why not just create a list? But it is nice because it doesn't require any library.if you are only going to mutate your tuple onceI suggest using mutabletuple(typename, field_names, default=MtNoDefault) from mutabletuple 0.2.

Although encyclopaedias are a different type of reference work, some use the word dictionary in their names (e.g., biographical dictionaries).dictionary(Read H.L. Menckens 1926 Britannica essay on American English.)Basically, a dictionary lists a set of words with information about them. The list may attempt to be a complete inventory of a language or may be only a small segment of it. A short list, sometimes at the back of a book, is often called a glossary. When a word list is an index to a limited body of writing, with references to each passage, it is called a concordance. Theoretically, a good dictionary could be compiled by organizing into one list a large number of concordances. A word list that consists of geographic names only is called a gazetteer.The word lexicon designates a wordbook, but it also has a special abstract meaning among linguists, referring to the body of separable structural units of which the language is made up. In this sense, a preliterate culture has a lexicon long before its units are written in a dictionary. Scholars in England sometimes use lexis to designate this lexical element of language.The compilation of a dictionary is lexicography; lexicology is a branch of linguistics in which, with the utmost scientific rigour, the theories that lexicographers use in the solution of their problems are developed.The phrase dictionary order takes for granted that alphabetical order will be followed, and yet the alphabetical order has been called a tyranny that makes dictionaries less useful than they might be if compiled in some other order. (So too, dictionary order becomes a meaningless term for any language that lacks an alphabet.) The assembling of words into groups related by some principle, as by their meanings, can be done, and such a work is often called a thesaurus or synonymy. Such works, however, need an index for ease of reference, and it is unlikely that alphabetical order will be superseded except in specialized works.The distinction between a dictionary and an encyclopaedia is easy to state but difficult to carry out in a practical way: a dictionary explains words, whereas an encyclopaedia explains things. Because words achieve their usefulness by reference to things, however, it is difficult to construct a dictionary without considerable attention to the objects and abstractions designated.A monolingual dict']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.685051679611206, 0.6897639036178589]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}

Inside it, you have two files, main.py, which is the file where you write your Python code, and example.txt, which is the file you would like to open. That file contains the following contents:Both files are on the same level in the folder, so here is how you would reference example.txt when using the open() function:The second optional argument that the open() function accepts is mode. It specifies whether yo", "s an alternative available.The with keyword ensures that the file is automatically closed upon code execution.The general syntax for the with keyword when used with the open() function is the following:So, here is how you would rewrite the code from the previous example using the with keyword instead of the close() method:How to Read a Text File Using the readline() Method in Python If you want to read only one single individual line from a text file, use the readline() method:The text file example.txt has two lines inside it, but the readline() method only reads one line from the file and returns it.The readline() method also adds a trailing newline character at the end of the string. You can optionally pass a size argument to the readline() method, which specifies the length of the returned line and the maximum number of bytes it will read.How to Read a Text File Using the readlines() Method in Python The readlines() method reads all the lines from a file, going through the file line by line.It then returns a list of strings:The readlines() method read all the lines in one go and stored each line from the text file as a single list item inside a list. The readlines() method also added a newline character at the end of each line.How to Read a Text File Using a for Loop in Python An alternative way of reading a file line by line in Python is using a for loop, which is the most Pythonic approach to reading a file:The open() function returns an iterable object.The for loop gets paired with the in keyword - they iterate over the returned iterable file object and read each line inside it.ConclusionHopefully, this article helped you understand how to read a file line by line in Python using the read(), readline(), and readlines() methods and a for loop.Thank you for reading, and happy coding!

Typically this API may be written in C or simply can't be modified by OP.  Jaffa Commented Mar 6, 2013 at 10:56 How do you expect the compiler to know that you mean to pass a,c and e and not some other triplet? In a function declaration all parameters after a parameter with default value should have default values. So you can never have default b and d - whenever you pass only three parameters to this function it would mean you want to use the default values for the last 2 parameters and these are d and e. Move your optional parameters as last in the function. Thank You for the answer but our company currently ships APIs which such functions, but their parameters are not simple int, hence passing NULL solves the problem. So do you mean I can tell my boss that those funcs are incorrect C++ usage?  Cool_Coder Commented Mar 6, 2013 at 10:43 @CAD_coding what you say is completely different. Passing NULL as argument is not at all as ommitting the argument.

The product doc says that these are default args, so I dont know how our customers are using it. But isnt it a bad technique?  Cool_Coder Commented Mar 6, 2013 at 10:46 There is no direct way to achieve what you are looking for.The first alternative would be the use of boost::optional<T> for the parameters.Another alternative might be named parameters, as implemented in the Boost Parameter Library.If you think that this might be something for you and you want further elaboration on how these could be used for your use case, let me know and I'll edit this answer.

Java is an independent Java program that operates on a client or a server. The Java Virtual Machine executes the commands, and Java programs have complete access to the computers resources, just like any other programming language running in its native environment. There are four main types of Java applications: standalone, web, enterprise and mobile.

Gillis, Technical Writer and Editor Sarah Lewis What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well suited for software that is large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications. For example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial for collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.The first step in OOP is to collect all of the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and identify how they relate to each other -- an exercise known as data modeling.Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being who is described by properties like name and address, to small computer programs, such as widgets.Once an object is known, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method. Objects can communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages.What is the structure of object-oriented programming?The structure, or building blocks, of object-oriented programming include the following:Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods.Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract en', "BackJan 5, 2023Jan 5, 2023The Top 3 Object Oriented Programming LanguagesIn this article, we'll cover the fundamentals of object oriented programming. Plus, the top 3 object oriented programming languages for developers, along with their pros and cons.Object oriented programming, also known as OOP, is nothing new. Its been around since the 1970s. However, unlike tools and frameworks that come and go, object-oriented programming is still relevant today. Its not a programming language or tool, and many popular frameworks are designed with Object Oriented Programming concepts in mind. Therefore, if you want to be a serious developer, you need to understand object oriented programming.Prerequisites:Prerequisites:Basic knowledge of Java, C++, and Python fundamentals and syntax.What Best Defines a Programming Language?An artificial language used to convey instructions to a machine is known as a programming language. Its used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine.A program is a list of instructions given to the machine. Programming languages are divided into two types: low-level and high-level languages.Low-level languages are languages that the machine understands. There are two types: assembly and machine language.High-level languages are user-friendly and closer to human language, and they are of two types: procedural and object oriented.What is the Goal of Object Oriented Programming?Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm centered around objects rather than functions. The OOP style of programming tells us to divide our code into different objects that contain fields and methods. Fields are variables, and methods are functions. We can do a variety of things when we divide our project, including protecting data from some objects or sharing it with different objects.Object oriented programming enables programmers to write useful code in different programs. For this reason, it is widely used in modern software engineering.Several progr"]], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.5213293657249282, 0.5992753722066388]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}
2024_10_26 Model Response: agent_2:In object-oriented programming, developers focus on the objects they want to control rather than the underlying logic required to do so. This methodology is ideal for large, intricate programs that need to be constantly updated or maintained. For instance, OOP can be utilized in manufacturing system simulation software. By organizing software around data types instead of functions and logic, this approach enhances codeability, scalability and efficiency. Once an object is identified, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it.

Java applications compiled into bytecode can run on any operating system or platform that has a compatible JVM installed. This means that a Java program developed on a Windows machine can run on a Linux system without any modifications, as long as the appropriate JVM is present. Does JVM offer any security features? Yes, JVM provides various security features to ensure the safe execution of Java applications. One of the key security features is the Java Security Manager, which allows you to define a security policy for your application. This policy specifies the permissions granted to the code running within the JVM, controlling what actions the code can perform, such as accessing files, networks, or system resources. How does JVM handle memory management? JVM manages memory through a combination of automatic memory allocation and garbage collection. It dynamically allocates memory for objects, and when objects are no longer referenced, the garbage collector deallocates the memory. What is the difference between a JVM language and a JVM implementation? A JVM language (e.g., Kotlin, Scala) is a programming language that runs on the JVM and compiles to Java bytecode. It leverages the JVM's runtime environment but may have its own syntax and features. A JVM implementation (e.g., Oracle HotSpot, OpenJDK) is the actual software that interprets and executes Java bytecode. Different implementations can have varying performance characteristics and optimizations. Can I customize the JVM behavior through command-line options? Yes, JVM provides a wide range of command-line options that allow customization of its behavior. These options can control various aspects such as memory allocation, garbage collection algorithms, and performance profiling. Is JVM platform-independent? Yes, JVM is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java applications can run on any system that has a compatible JVM. This is achieved through the interpretation and execution of Java bytecode, which is standardized across JVM implementations. How does JVM handle thread synchronization? JVM provides built-in mechanisms like locks, monitors, and synchronized blocks to facilitate thread synchronization. These mechanisms ensure that multiple threads can safely access shared resources without interference or data corruption. Can JVM be embedded in other environments or devices? Yes, JVM can be embedded in oth", 'A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM is detailed by a specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation. Having a specification ensures interoperability of Java programs across different implementations so that program authors using the Java Development Kit (JDK) need not worry about idiosyncrasies of the underlying hardware platform. The JVM reference implementation is developed by the OpenJDK project as open source code and includes a JIT compiler called HotSpot. The commercially supported Java releases available from Oracle are based on the OpenJDK runtime. Eclipse OpenJ9 is another open source JVM for OpenJDK. JVM specificationThe Java virtual machine is an abstract (virtual) computer defined by a specification. It is a part of the Java runtime environment. The garbage collection algorithm used and any internal optimization of the Java virtual machine instructions (their translation into machine code) are not specified. The main reason for this omission is to not unnecessarily constrain implementers. Any Java application can be run only inside some concrete implementation of the abstract specification of the Java virtual machine.[2] Starting with Java Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 5.0, changes to the JVM specification have been developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 924.[3] As of 2006[update], changes to the specification to support changes proposed to the class file format (JSR 202)[4] are being done as a maintenance release of JSR 924. The specification for the JVM was published as the blue book,[5] whose preface states: We intend that this specification should sufficiently document the Java Virtual Machine to make possible compatible clean-room implementations.

2024_10_26 Model Response: Sure sir, heres the rephrased rendition of it.In essence, JVM stands out due to its ability to operate on any operating system or platform that has a compatible Java VM installed. This means that a Java program created on a Windows machine can seamlessly transfer to a Linux system, provided that the appropriate JavaVM is present. 

When it comes to security measures, the Java Security Manager is one of the key security features. It allows you to establish a security policy for your application, which specifies the permissions granted to the code running within the jVM, controlling what actions the software can perform, such as accessing files, networks, or system resources. How does jvm manage memory through a combination of automatic memory allocation and garbage collection? It dynamically allocates memory for objects, and when objects are no longer referenced the garbage collector deallocates the memory.

The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The power of the presidency has grown substantially[12] since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789.[6] While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush.[13][14] In modern times, the president is one of the world\'s most powerful political figures and the leader of the world\'s only remaining superpower.[15][16][17][18] As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power. For much of the 20th century, especially during the Cold War, the U.S. president was often called "the leader of the free world".[19] Article II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers. Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world\'s most expensive military, which has the second-largest nuclear arsenal. The president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of separation of powers, Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.[20] In rec', 'of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party inevitably have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party\'s presidential candidate. The coattail effect, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party\'s candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party\'s caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective. Global leaderWith the rise of the United States as a superpower in the 20th century, and the United States having the world\'s largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world\'s most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of NATO, and the country\'s strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the European Union, have led to the moniker that the president is the "leader of the free world". Selection processEligibilityArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must: be a natural-born citizen of the United States;be at least 35 years old;be a resident in the United States for at least 14 years.[126]A person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions: Under Article I, Section 3, Clause 7, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.[127][128]Under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.[129] There is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding Confederates from public office after the Ci']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.9345219135284424, 0.96018385887146]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}

Modifiers play a key role in encapsulation by controlling access to the classes, methods, and variables of an application.Modifiers in Java can be broadly categorized into two groups: Access Modifiers and Non-Access Modifiers. Each group serves a distinct purpose and applies to different programming scenarios.Access Modifiers: These modifiers define the visibility of classes, methods, and variables to the rest of your application. Java provides four levels of access control through its access modifiers: public, protected, default (no modifier), and private. The choice of access modifier for a class, method, or variable determines where that element can be accessed from, which is essential for encapsulating the internals of an object and for designing the public interface that other parts of your application will interact with.Access Modifiers:Non-Access Modifiers: Beyond controlling access, Java allows you to modify the behavior of classes, methods, and variables using non-access modifiers. These include keywords like static, final, abstract, synchronized, and volatile, each serving different purposes such as defining class methods that can be called without an instance of the class, creating constants, specifying methods that must be implemented by subclasses, and more. These modifiers enable you to enforce certain design patterns and usage constraints on your classes and their members, contributing to a more strong and maintainable codebase.Non-Access Modifiers:To dive deeper into the world of Java modifiers, lets start by understanding the syntax and application of each modifier. This will not only help in grasping their theoretical aspects but also in applying them practically to control access and behavior in a Java program.

There is a tradeoff between a models ability to minimize bias and variance. Gaining a proper understanding of these errors would help us not only to build accurate models but also to avoid the mistake of overfitting and underfitting.So lets start with the basics and see how they make difference to our machine learning Models.What is bias?What is bias?Bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict. Model with high bias pays very little attention to the training data and oversimplifies the model. It always leads to high error on training and test data.What is variance?What is variance?Variance is the variability of model prediction for a given data point or a value which tells us spread of our data. Model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and does not generalize on the data which it hasnt seen before. As a result, such models perform very well on training data but has high error rates on test data.MathematicallyMathematicallyLet the variable we are trying to predict as Y and other covariates as X. We assume there is a relationship between the two such thatY=f(X) + eWhere e is the error term and its normally distributed with a mean of 0.We will make a model f^(X) of f(X) using linear regression or any other modeling technique.So the expected squared error at a point x isThe Err(x) can be further decomposed asErr(x) is the sum of Bias, variance and the irreducible error.Irreducible error is the error that cant be reduced by creating good models. It is a measure of the amount of noise in our data.

An algorithm cant be more complex and less complex at the same time.Total ErrorTotal ErrorTo build a good model, we need to find a good balance between bias and variance such that it minimizes the total error.An optimal balance of bias and variance would never overfit or underfit the model.Therefore understanding bias and variance is critical for understanding the behavior of prediction models.Thank you for reading!Written by Seema SinghTowards Data ScienceData ScientistHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.658465817639626, 0.7639774545699323]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}
2024_10_26 Model Response: agent_2:The trade-off between a model's ability to minimize bias and variance is known as bias. To comprehend this tradeoff, we need to understand how these errors affect our machine learning Models. Specifically, let us consider the relationship between Y=f(X) + e where e represents the error term and it's normally distributed with a mean of 0. This means that the expected squared error at a point x is the sum of Bias, variance, and the irreducible error. It is important to note that no matter how well we make our model, our data will have a certain amount of noise. Therefore, it is crucial to take into account these factors when designing models.

There is a tradeoff between a models ability to minimize bias and variance. Gaining a proper understanding of these errors would help us not only to build accurate models but also to avoid the mistake of overfitting and underfitting.So lets start with the basics and see how they make difference to our machine learning Models.What is bias?What is bias?Bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict. Model with high bias pays very little attention to the training data and oversimplifies the model. It always leads to high error on training and test data.What is variance?What is variance?Variance is the variability of model prediction for a given data point or a value which tells us spread of our data. Model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and does not generalize on the data which it hasnt seen before. As a result, such models perform very well on training data but has high error rates on test data.MathematicallyMathematicallyLet the variable we are trying to predict as Y and other covariates as X. We assume there is a relationship between the two such thatY=f(X) + eWhere e is the error term and its normally distributed with a mean of 0.We will make a model f^(X) of f(X) using linear regression or any other modeling technique.So the expected squared error at a point x isThe Err(x) can be further decomposed asErr(x) is the sum of Bias, variance and the irreducible error.Irreducible error is the error that cant be reduced by creating good models. It is a measure of the amount of noise in our data.

2024_10_26 Model Response: What is the relationship between Bias and Variance?

The difference between the average value predicted by our Machine Learning model and the correct target value is referred to as bias. A model that makes incorrect predictions about a dataset is called a biased model. This model oversimplifies the target function to make it easier to learn. Underfitting: Due to the model being too simple, it cannot learn complex features of a training data, making it inefficient when solving complex problems.

Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves are graphs showing classifiers' performance by plotting the true positive rate and false positive rate. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) measures the performance of machine learning algorithms. ROC curves visually depict the statistical accuracy of classifier selection, but the graphs original use began in signal detection. Since the 1980s, ROC curves gained popularity in medical diagnostics testing and, more recently, for analyzing the performance of machine learning algorithms. Read further to discover the uses of the ROC curve, how AUC works, uses for the ROC curve in machine learning, and the pros and cons of ROC curves.Types of classification metrics in machine learningTo help understand when to use an ROC curve, lets examine some other common classification metrics in machine learning:Confusion matrix: A generated two-column matrix of all the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives that a machine learning algorithm producedConfusion matrix: A generated two-column matrix of all the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives that a machine learning algorithm producedRecall: The ratio of positive values to predicted positive values, also called sensitivity or the true positive rate in machine learningRecall: The ratio of positive values to predicted positive values, also called sensitivity or the true positive rate in machine learningSpecificity: The ratio of negative values predicted to be negative values, also called specificity or the true negative rate in machine learningSpecificity: The ratio of negative values predicted to be negative values, also called specificity or the true negative rate in machine learningPrecision: The ratio of true positives in predicted to all positives predicted, also called the positive predictive val", 'learning:True positive rate: A ratio of true positive predictions divided by the true positives plus false negative predictions (TPR = TP / TP + FN)True positive rate: A ratio of true positive predictions divided by the true positives plus false negative predictions (TPR = TP / TP + FN)False positive rate: A ratio of total false positive predictions divided by the false positive plus true negative predictions (FPR = FP / FP + TN)False positive rate: A ratio of total false positive predictions divided by the false positive plus true negative predictions (FPR = FP / FP + TN)The true positive and false positive rates at each point on the curve depict the rate at each decision classification threshold. To create the ROC curve, the scale goes from zero to one, with an ideal rate being one for positives and zero for negatives. The ROC curve has no bias towards classifiers and remains independent of the conditions it works under, making it useful for predictions with both balanced and imbalanced problems. Area under the ROC curveA score is given to them to compare the ROC curve of multiple classifiers based on a calculation of the area under the ROC curve, also known as AUC or ROCAUC. This score ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being a perfect classifier. To calculate AUC, you use trapezoidal integration, which means first using the FPR and TPR values to divide the area under the ROC curve into trapezoids. Then, you add together the areas of those trapezoids to determine the AUC. The AUC is the average probability of how a model will classify positive responses and negative responses.AUC measures the ranking of predictions, not the accuracy of independent values, making it useful for telling you how well a model makes predictions regardless of the classification. This, however, makes AUC not a useful test if you need to examine the accuracy of individual classifications. What is ROC curve used for?In machine learning, ROC curves measure the performance of various machine learning algorithm classifications. In conjunction with the use of AUC, ROC curves show how well an algorithm classifies objects through the invariance of AUC when it comes to the class being analyzed. A ROC curve focuses on finding the errors and benefits classifiers use to organize classes, making ROC graphs a useful analysis when comparing two classes in something like a diagnostic test that tests whether a condition is present or not present in an individual class.

Instead will try to explain the intuitive difference between them.The main intuitive difference between the L1 and L2 regularization is that L1 regularization tries to estimate the median of the data while the L2 regularization tries to estimate the mean of the data to avoid overfitting.As we can see from the formula of L1 and L2 regularization, L1 regularization adds the penalty term in cost function by adding the absolute value of weight(Wj) parameters, while L2 regularization adds the squared value of weights(Wj) in the cost function.While taking derivative of the cost function, in L1 regularization it will estimate around the median of the data. Let me explain it in this way  Suppose you take an arbitrary value from the data (assume data is spread along a horizontal line). If you then move in one direction to some distance d, suppose in the backward direction, then while calculating loss, the values to the one side (let say left side) of the chosen point will have a lesser loss value while on another side will contribute more in the loss function calculation.L1 regularizationd, Therefore, to minimize the loss function, we should try to estimate a value that should lie at the mid of the data distribution. That value will also be the median of the data distribution mathematically.medianWhile in L2 regularization, while calculating the loss function in the gradient calculation step, the loss function tries to minimize the loss by subtracting it from the average of the data distribution.L2 regularization, Thats the main intuitive difference between the L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization technique.Another difference between them is that L1 regular', ' and L2 regularization as being the same, especially since they both prevent overfitting. However, despite the similarities in objectives (and names), theres a major difference in how these regularization techniques prevent overfitting. To understand this better, lets build an artificial dataset, and a linear regression model without regularization to predict the training data. Scikit-learn has an out-of-the-box implementation of linear regression, with an optimized implementation of Gradient Descent optimization built-in. Lets see it in action:In the next section, well dive into the intuitions behind L1 and L2 regularization.L1 regularization L1 regularization, also known as L1 norm or Lasso (in regression problems), combats overfitting by shrinking the parameters towards 0. This makes some features obsolete. Its a form of feature selection, because when we assign a feature with a 0 weight, were multiplying the feature values by 0 which returns 0, eradicating the significance of that feature. If the input features of our model have weights closer to 0, our L1 norm would be sparse. A selection of the input features would have weights equal to zero, and the rest would be non-zero. For example, imagine we want to predict housing prices using machine learning. Consider the following features: Street  road access,Street Neighborhood  property location,Neighborhood Accessibility  transport access,Accessibility Year Built  year the house was built in,Year BuiltRooms  number of rooms,Rooms Kitchens  number of kitchens,Kitchens Fireplaces  number of fireplaces in the house. Fireplaces When predicting the value of a house, intuition tells us that different input features wont have the same influence on the price. For example, its highly likely that the neighborhood or the number of rooms have a higher influence on the price of the property than the number of fireplaces.So, our L1 regularization technique would assign the fireplaces feature with a zero weight, because it doesnt have a significant effect on the price. We can expect the neighborhood and the number rooms to be assigned non-zero weights, because these features influence the price of a property significantly. Mathematically, we express L1 regularization by extending our loss function like such: Essentially, when we use L1 regularization, we are penalizing the absolute value of the weights. In real world environments, we often have features that are highly correlated. For example, the year']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.5008038808840355, 0.5432948911170513]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}
2024_10_26 Model Response: The contrast between L1 and L2 regularization can be explained by Dhaval Taunk through his analysis of Analytics Vidhya-1. Rather than delving into the mathematical aspects of these techniques, he offers an explanation of how they differ from one another. For instance, when calculating the loss function in the gradient calculation step, L 1 regularizes the data by adding the absolute value of weight(Wj) parameters to the cost function. On the other hand, while taking derivative values from the original data, this method estimates the median of the resulting data. Therefore, in order to minimize the amount of data lost, we need to estimate a value that falls somewhere between the average and median values of our data distribution mathematically.

While generative models create new data by estimating the joint probability distribution, discriminative models focus on classifying data by estimating the conditional probability. Examples include Gaussian Mixture Models for generative and Support Vector Machines for discriminative models, highlighting their distinct applications in tasks like classification and data generation.Key TakeawaysDiscriminative models learn the decision boundary between classes, while generative models aim to model the underlying data distribution.Discriminative models are often simpler and faster to train than generative models but may not perform as well on tasks where the underlying data distribution is complex or uncertain.Generative models can be used for a wider range of tasks, including image and text generation, but may require more training data and computational resources.Q1. What is the difference between discriminative and probabilistic models?A. Discriminative models focus on modeling the decision boundary between classes, while probabilistic models focus on modeling the underlying probability distribution of the data.Q2. Are discriminative models used for classification tasks?A. Discriminative models support classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the class label of an input based on some features. They model the decision boundary between classes rather than modeling the distribution of the data.Q3. What are example of generative models?A. Generative model examples include Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for image generation and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for creating realistic data like images and text.Q4.

The generative-discriminative "dichotomy" is in fact a spectrum which you can even smoothly interpolate between [4]. spectrumAs a consequence, this distinction gets arbitrary and confusing, especially when many popular models do not neatly fall into one or the other [5,6], or are in fact hybrid models (combinations of classically "discriminative" and "generative" models).Nevertheless it\'s still a highly useful and common distinction to make. We can list some clear-cut examples of generative and discriminative models, both canonical and recent:Generative: Naive Bayes, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE), normalizing flows.Discriminative: Support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, most deep neural networks.There is also a lot of interesting work deeply examining the generative-discriminative divide [7] and spectrum [4,8], and even transforming discriminative models into generative models [9].In the end, definitions are constantly evolving, especially in this rapidly growing field :) It\'s best to take them with a pinch of salt, and maybe even redefine them for yourself and others.SourcesPossibly originating from "Machine Learning - Discriminative and Generative" (Tony Jebara, 2004).Crash Course in Machine Learning by GoogleThe Generative-Discriminative Fallacy"Principled Hybrids of Generative and Discriminative Models" (Lasserre et al., 2006)@shimao\'s questionBinu Jasim\'s answerComparing logistic regression and naive Bayes: cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook/NBayesLogReg.pdf "On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers" Comment on "On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers" cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook/NBayesLogReg.pdf"On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers"Comment on "On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DengJaitly2015-ch1-2.pdf"Your classifier is secretly an energy-based model" (Grathwohl et al., 2019)Stanford CS236 notes: Technically, a probabilistic discriminative model is also a generative model of the labels conditioned on the data.

2024_10_26 Model Response: Alright sir, heres the rearticulated version of the sentence.In terms of machine learning, there exist two primary approaches: generative and discriminative models. While the former generates new data through the estimation of a joint probability distribution, the latter focuses on classifying data based on the conditional probability. Examples of these types of models include Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines, which highlight their unique roles in various fields such as classification and data generation.

When it comes to decision-making processes, it's important to understand which approach to employ for a given task to create a more precise machine-learning solution. This is particularly important when dealing with complex or uncertain data distributions, where the underlying data distribution may require more training data and computational resources to model accurately. To illustrate this point, consider the case of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are used for generating realistic data like images and text. On the other hand, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a type of neural network primarily utilized for tasks like image classification, not generating data.

However there is no lack of methods and theories discussed among research communities to identify ways to effectively address such challenges. Data from the financial domain continue to be highly imbalanced with almost all of data belonging to genuine groups while training models for credit risk assessment. We are left with only a fraction or minuscule of data for the fraudulent group. This article discusses a couple of classifiers for dealing with the extremely imbalanced credit dataset.credit datasetWe will start with importing libraries in python.Now we will import the data.The majority of the samples in the credit card dataset are overrepresented target values belonging to non-fraud class in the classification of fraud detection.We will now calculate the number of instances in fraudulent or genuine class.Algorithm level methodsAlgorithm level methodsIn algorithm level methods, the classifier itself is made adaptable to the imbalance nature of the datasets. The feature weights in the classifier model are changed according to the number of instances in the feature vector. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees, the two most commonly used classifiers are adaptable to imbalance in datasets.Support Vector Machines (SVM) Decision Trees, SVMSVMBefore learning to handle the imbalance data with SVM, let us understand how SVM classifies data points.SVM is a classification model that classifies the data points into two classes depending upon the hyperplane.

2024_10_26 Model Response: agent_2:I have a large dataset with 60 million rows and 11 features. It is highly imbalanced, 20:1 (signal:background). As I saw, there are two ways to tackle this problem: First: Under-sampling/Oversampling. I have two problems/questions in this way. If I make under- sampling before train test split, I am losing a lot of data. But more important, if I train a model on a balanced dataset (let's say the frequency of my signal data) and because model is trained on and evaluated, model will perform well.

If I want to use class weight penalty for XBG, Random Forest, Logistic Regression?

Categorical data, from gender to product types, are integral to understanding everything from consumer behavior to healthcare outcomes. In this guide, we'll unravel the complexities of categorical data analysis, equipping you with the knowledge and techniques to decode the stories hidden within these distinct groups. What is Categorical Data?Categorical data, also known as qualitative data, is a type of data that represents discrete, distinct categories or groups. Unlike numerical data, which can be measured and quantified, categorical data fall into specific, non-numeric categories. Categorical data are often used to classify items or observations into different groups based on particular characteristics or attributes. Categorical data can be further divided into two main types:Nominal Data: Categories have no inherent order or ranking in nominal data. Each category is distinct and unrelated to the others. Nominal data are often used for classification purposes.Examples include gender (male, female, other), colors (red, blue, green), and countries (USA, Canada, UK).:Ordinal Data: Ordinal data, on the other hand, represent categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between categories may not be uniform or precisely defined. Ordinal data allow you to express preferences or degrees of difference between categories.Examples include education levels (high school, bachelor's degree, master's degree) and customer satisfaction ratings (very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied).:Categorical data are prevalent in various fields, such as market research, social sciences, healthcare, and more. Understanding the nature of categorical data is essential for conducting effective data analysis and drawing meaningful insights.Importance of Cate", 'rch and Academia: In academic research, categorical data analysis is employed to test hypotheses, validate theories, and contribute to the body of knowledge in various disciplines.Categorical data analysis is vital in gaining insights, making informed decisions, and contributing to advancements in various fields. It enables researchers, analysts, and organizations to harness the power of qualitative data for a wide range of applications and purposes.Types of Categorical DataCategorical data can be classified into two main types: nominal data and ordinal data. Understanding the distinctions between these types is essential for practical data analysis and interpretation.Nominal DataNominal data represents categories or groups with no inherent order or ranking. In other words, the categories are distinct and unrelated to each other. Nominal data is primarily used for classification purposes. Here are some examples:Color: Categories like "Red," "Blue," and "Green" have no inherent order.Color:Gender: Categories like "Male," "Female," and "Other" are distinct, with no ranking.Gender:Country: Categories like "USA," "Canada," and "UK" represent distinct nations.Country:When working with nominal data, it\'s important to note that mathematical operations such as addition or subtraction are not meaningful because there is no inherent order among the categories. However, you can perform certain operations like counting the frequency of each category or calculating proportions.Ordinal DataOrdinal data, on the other hand, represents categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between categories may not be uniform or precisely defined. This type of data allows you to express preferences or degrees of difference between categories. Here are some examples:Education Level: Categories like "High School," "Bachelor\'s Degree," and "Master\'s Degree" have a precise order, indicating increasing levels of education. However, the difference in knowledge between these categories may not be uniform.Education Level:Customer Satisfaction: Categories like "Very Dissatisfied," "Dissatisfied," "Neutral," "Satisfied," and "Very Satisfied" reflect a degree of satisfaction. While there\'s a clear ranking, the intervals between these categories may not be equal.Customer Satisfaction:Ordinal data analysis considers the order of categories but doesn\'t assume that the differences between them are consistent.

What does this mean and why do we do this?Lets say the input data consists of several features x1, x2,xn. Each feature might have a different range of values. For instance, values for feature x1 might range from 1 through 5, while values for feature x2 might range from 1000 to 99999.So, for each feature column separately, we take the values of all samples in the dataset and compute the mean and the variance.

The reason we normalize is partly to ensure that our model can generalize appropriately.Now coming back to Batch normalization, it is a process to make neural networks faster and more stable through adding extra layers in a deep neural network. The new layer performs the standardizing and normalizing operations on the input of a layer coming from a previous layer.But what is the reason behind the term Batch in batch normalization? A typical neural network is trained using a collected set of input data called batch. Similarly, the normalizing process in batch normalization takes place in batches, not as a single input.batchLets understand this through an example, we have a deep neural network as shown in the following image.Initially, our inputs X1, X2, X3, X4 are in normalized form as they are coming from the pre-processing stage. When the input passes through the first layer, it transforms, as a sigmoid function applied over the dot product of input X and the weight matrix W. Similarly, this transformation will take place for the second layer and go till the last layer L as shown in the following image. Although, our input X was normalized with time the output will no longer be on the same scale. As the data go through multiple layers of the neural network and L activation functions are applied, it leads to an internal co-variate shift in the data.How does Batch Normalization work?Since by now we have a clear idea of why we need Batch Normalization in CNN, lets understand how it works.

Meanwhile, Spearmans correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the correlation between related DEGs and each TME infiltration cell type content.The AUROCs of the six genes in the early diagnosis of septic shock were remarkable, indicating a better predictive efficiency than classical biomarkers such as CRP and PCT. Moreover, the intervention with the signal pathways that are related to these six hub genes may help us to achieve a better treatment response and prognosis for septic shock patients. Our study had inevitable limitations. First, to guarantee universalization and reduce selective bias to a minimum, more verification must be put in place, and larger numbers of septic shock patients and healthy donors should be involved. Second, in this study, our team merely highlighted markers that originated from white blood cells in circulating blood. Circulation markers related to cells from other organs with function disorders, such as tissue macrophages and blood vessel cells, may also participate in an intricate clinical process of septic disease, but these were not investigated in the present study. Last, as we obtained most of our data from specimens of septic shock who were minors and healthy donors minors through the biological information assay, the outcomes cannot be uncritically applied to adult septic cases. Further experimental analysis is still required to validate these findings. In addition, from the vast GEO database, not all septic shock samples could be included; thus, GSE33118, GSE26440, and GSE9692 were chosen in this study, owing to their relatively large sample sizes and representativeness. However, the sample sizes of the three datasets used in this study were small; thus, from a bioinformatics perspective, the results should be further verified, and an increased number of samples should be studied to increase the credibility of results. Our study has shown that in septic patients the mRNA levels of the CD177, CLEC5A, CYSTM1, MCEMP1, MMP8, and RGL4 genes were higher in septic patients than in control participants, suggesting the reliability of the preliminary clinical specimen. There is a lack of statistical difference between CLEC51 and CYSTM1 among the six genes tested in an mRNA expression analysis. In addition, only the protein levels of CD177 and MMP8 were verified owing to the limited experimental time. In a nutsh', "ll membrane receptors, cell proteins, metabolites, and soluble receptors. We also provide an overview of immune response biomarkers that can help identify or differentiate between systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, septic shock, and sepsis-associated encephalopathy.

It may be helpful as a theranostic for identifying suitable patients for therapeutic intervention and titrating the degree and/or duration of intervention. A biomarker should be accurate and reproducible. In the ideal scenario, the biomarker (or combination of biomarkers) should offer both high specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing a condition, but either alone may be adequate as a 'rule-in' or 'rule-out' test.Sepsis represents a dysregulated immune response to infection that leads to organ dysfunction [1]. Host response biomarkers play a critical role in diagnosis, early recognition of organ dysfunction, risk stratification, prognostication, and patient management, including antibiotic stewardship. Biomarkers may also be helpful for trial enrichment to identify suitable patients and/or risk categorization for an intervention. A wide range of biomarkers, measured by a host of different technologies, are being investigated to discriminate a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) rapidly, which is an excessive defensive body's response to a harmful stressor (for example, infection, trauma, surgery, acute inflammation, ischemia or reperfusion, or cancer) [2] or early identification of infection-triggered organ dysfunction (sepsis). Also, the quick sepsis related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) is intended to raise suspicion of sepsis and encourage additional action; although, qSOFA is not a substitute for SIRS [3]. These biomarkers include measurement of acute-phase proteins, cytokines, chemokines, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), endothelial cell markers, leukocyte surface markers, non-coding RNAs, miRNA, and soluble receptors, as well as metabolites and alterations in gene expression (transcriptomics). Biomarkers may help stratify septic patients into biological phenotypes, for example, hyperinflammatory versus immunosuppressive. Biomarkers can also be used to identify gut permeability, "]], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.6295578960707051, 0.6994954162010931]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}

Despite advances in the understanding of biological systems and the development of cutting-edge technologies, the process is still long, costly with a high attrition rate. New approaches, such as artificial intelligence and novel in vitro technologies, are being used in an attempt to rationalize R&D and bring new drugs to patients faster, but several obstacles remain. Our hope is that one day, it becomes possible to rapidly design inexpensive, more specific, more effective, non-toxic, and personalized drugs. This is a goal towards which all authors of this article have devoted most of their careers.IntroductionDrug discovery has a long history and dates back to the early days of human civilization. In those ancient times, treatments were often discovered by chance or resulted from observation of nature, typically but not exclusively, using ingredients extracted from plants/animals, and not just used for physical remedy but also for spiritual healing. Modern drug discovery research started to being performed around the early 1900s. Nowadays, the development of a new medicine usually starts when basic research, often performed in academia, identifies a macromolecule (i.e., a molecule with a large molecular weight like genes/proteins), or a dysfunctional signaling pathway or a molecular mechanism apparently linked to a disease condition (pre-discovery stage) (Figure 1; Table 1) (Hefti, 2008; Hughes et al., 2011; Mohs and Greig, 2017; Villoutreix, 2021). In general, at this stage, research teams attempt to identify the so-called therapeutic targets (often a protein) that are linked to the disease state (Gashaw et al., 2012). To be nominated therapeutic target, scientists will also have to find therapeutic agents that modify the function of the perturbed target and restore health or alleviate symptoms. Finding the right target is however extremely challenging. Further, drugs are efficient in humans because of specific actions on the intended therapeutic target but also due to interactions with other, unintended (often unknown) targets! The process continues with the search of therapeutic agents followed by a preclinical phase, during which potential drugs are tested in a battery of animal models, to demonstrate safety and select drug candidates (novel strategies to avoid animal testing are being developed, see below). Clinical studies in humans can then get started to establish safety and efficacy of the drugs in patients with the highest benefit-to-ri', 'MINI REVIEW articleDrug discovery and development: introduction to the general public and patient groups1Evotec SE, Molecular Architects, Integrated Drug Discovery, Campus Curie, Toulouse, France2NeuroDiderot Department, Inserm UMR 1141, Robert-Debr Hospital, Universit Paris Cit, Paris, France3Onco-Dermatology and Therapies, Inserm UMRS976, Hpital Saint Louis, France Institut de Recherche Saint Louis, Universit Paris Cit, Paris, France4Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States5Akttyva Therapeutics, Inc., Mansfield, MA, United StatesFinding new drugs usually consists of five main stages: 1) a pre-discovery stage in which basic research is performed to try to understand the mechanisms leading to diseases and propose possible targets (e.g., proteins); 2) the drug discovery stage, during which scientists search for molecules (two main large families, small molecules and biologics) or other therapeutic strategies that interfere or cure the investigated disease or at least alleviate the symptoms; 3) the preclinical development stage that focuses on clarifying the mode of action of the drug candidates, investigates potential toxicity, validates efficacy on various in vitro and in vivo models, and starts evaluate formulation; 4) the clinical stage that investigates the drug candidate in humans; 5) the reviewing, approval and post-market monitoring stage during which the drug is approved or not.

Each agent not only considers its own actions but also accounts for the actions of others, which increases the complexity of the training process.However, the structure of MARL, with multiple decision-makers, closely mirrors many real-world scenarios, making it a valuable approach to solve complex decision-making problems. For example, in a MARL scenario with a team of strikers trying to score against a goalie, the strikers in the simulation environment (Unity) need to learn how to cooperate. The results of their training are shown belowApplication Area  Dogfight TacticsDuring the internship, I focused on training agents in a simulated dogfighting environment (Fig 3), an adversarial scenario where agents from one team attempt to take down agents from another team.

Machine learning is changing, or will change, every industry, and leaders need to understand the basic principles, the potential, and the limitations, said MIT computer science professor Aleksander Madry, director of the MIT Center for Deployable Machine Learning.While not everyone needs to know the technical details, they should understand what the technology does and what it can and cannot do, Madry added. I dont think anyone can afford not to be aware of whats happening.That includes being aware of the social, societal, and ethical implications of machine learning. It's important to engage and begin to understand these tools, and then think about how you're going to use them well. We have to use these [tools] for the good of everybody, said Dr. Joan LaRovere, MBA 16, a pediatric cardiac intensive care physician and co-founder of the nonprofit The Virtue Foundation. AI has so much potential to do good, and we need to really keep that in our lenses as we're thinking about this. How do we use this to do good and better the world?What is machine learning?What is machine learning?Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.The goal of AI is to create computer models that exhibit intelligent behaviors like humans, according to Boris Katz, a principal research scientist and head of the InfoLab Group at CSAIL. This means machines that can recognize a visual scene, understand a text written in natural language, or perform an action in the physical world.Machine learning is one way to use AI. It was defined in the 1950s by AI pioneer Arthur Samuel as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.The definition holds true, according toMikey Shulman, a lecturer at MIT Sloan and head of machine learning at Kensho, which specializes in artificial intelligence for the finance and U.S. intelligence communities. He compared the traditional way of programming computers, or software 1.0, to baking, where a recipe calls for precise amounts of ingredients and tells the baker to mix for an exact amount of time.

He compared the traditional way of programming computers, or software 1.0, to baking, where a recipe calls for precise amounts of ingredients and tells the baker to mix for an exact amount of time. Traditional programming similarly requires creating detailed instructions for the computer to follow.But in some cases, writing a program for the machine to follow is time-consuming or impossible, such as training a computer to recognize pictures of different people. While humans can do this task easily, its difficult to tell a computer how to do it. Machine learning takes the approach of letting computers learn to program themselves through experience. Machine learning starts with data  numbers, photos, or text, like bank transactions, pictures of people or even bakery items, repair records, time series data from sensors, or sales reports. The data is gathered and prepared to be used as training data, or the information the machine learning model will be trained on. The more data, the better the program.From there, programmers choose a machine learning model to use, supply the data, and let the computer model train itself to find patterns or make predictions. Over time the human programmer can also tweak the model, including changing its parameters, to help push it toward more accurate results. (Research scientist Janelle Shanes website AI Weirdness is an entertaining look at how machine learning algorithms learn and how they can get things wrong  as happened when an algorithm tried to generate recipes and created Chocolate Chicken Chicken Cake.)Some data is held out from the training data to be used as evaluation data, which tests how accurate the machine learning model is when it is shown new data. The result is a model that can be used in the future with different sets of data.Successful machine learning algorithms can do different things, Malone wrote in a recent research brief about AI and the future of work that was co-authored by MIT professor and CSAIL director Daniela Rus and Robert Laubacher, the associate director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.The function of a machine learning system can be descriptive, meaning that the system uses the data to explain what happened; predictive, meaning the system uses the data to predict what will happen; or prescriptive, meaning the']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.6169291379493934, 0.6607562044636994]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}

Americans spent some $700 million on costumes for their pets in 2023more than three times what they spent in 2010.Colonial Halloween festivities also featured the telling of ghost stories and mischief-making of all kinds. By the middle of the 19th century, annual autumn festivities were common, but Halloween was not yet celebrated everywhere in the country.In the second half of the 19th century, America was flooded with new immigrants. These new immigrants, especially the millions of Irish fleeing the Irish Potato Famine, helped to popularize the celebration of Halloween nationally.Gallery: White House Halloweens1 / 10: History of Trick-or-TreatingBorrowing from European traditions, Americans began to dress up in costumes and go house to house asking for food or money, a practice that eventually became todays trick-or-treat tradition. Young women believed that on Halloween they could divine the name or appearance of their future husband by doing tricks with yarn, apple parings or mirrors.In the late 1800s, there was a move in America to mold Halloween into a holiday more about community and neighborly get-togethers than about ghosts, pranks and witchcraft. At the turn of the century, Halloween parties for both children and adults became the most common way to celebrate the day. Parties focused on games, foods of the season and festive costumes.Parents were encouraged by newspapers and community leaders to take anything frightening or grotesque out of Halloween celebrations. Because of these efforts, Halloween lost most of its superstitious and religious overtones by the beginning of the 20th century.Halloween Parties By the 1920s and 1930s, Halloween had become a secular but community-centered holiday, with parades and town-wide Halloween parties as the featured entertainment. Despite the best efforts of many schools and communities, vandalism began to plague some celebrations in many communities during this time.By the 1950s, town leaders had successfully limited vandalism and Halloween had evolved into a holiday directed mainly at the young.

In theory, families could also prevent tricks being played on them by providing the neighborhood children with small treats.Thus, a new American tradition was born, and it has continued to grow.

In Halloween, a young boy named Michael Myers murders his 17-year-old sister and is committed to jail, only to escape as a teen on Halloween night and seek out his old home, and a new target. A direct sequel to the original "Halloween" was released in 2018, starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Nick Castle. A sequel to that, "Halloween Kills," was released in 2021; and a sequel to that, "Halloween Ends," was released in 2022. Considered a classic horror film down to its spooky soundtrack, "Halloween" inspired other iconic slasher films like Scream, Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13.

This fiber provides prebiotics too, which fuel your bodys probiotics and help these friendly bacteria survive and thrive. Eating foods with beta-glucan has also been linked to improved immunity and gut health.

It\'s still too early to say if the beta-glucan or other forms of soluble fiber added to oat milk during processing has all of the same effects as regularly eating oats. Some initial research has linked potential cholesterol-lowering benefits to beta-glucan in beverage form, but the advantages for your heart and immune system also depend on what else you eat each day.

Oats have also been linked to a reduced risk of heart diseasethat's because they contain a type of fiber called beta-glucan that's been shown to improve cholesterol levels and even help with blood sugar control. This fiber provides prebiotics too which fuel your bodys probiotics and help these friendly bacteria survive and thrive. Eating foods with beta glucan has been associated with improved immunity and gut health. All of this brings up the question: Does Oat milk have enough of that oat-superpower to make it as healthy as food made with the whole grains? It's still too early to say if the beta glucose or other forms of soluble fiber added to OAT milk during processing has all of the same effects as regularly eating oats. The FDA permits fortifying milk and non-dairy substitutes with vitamin D and vitamin A. One cup of fortified milk provides about 20% of your daily value for each

2024_11_26 Model Response: In Python, Pandas DataFrames are two-dimensional data structures with labeled rows and columns. To create this type of data frame, we need to use pandas library as an alias. We create a list named data and store the data that needs to be stored in DataFrame. Then, use pd.DataFrame(data,columns) to create the Data frame. The data represents the list created in line 2 and the columns represent the column labels. Now, let's talk about how we can concatenate multiple dataFrames using pandAS library. One of the simplest ways to do this is by using the concat function. This is done by creating a set of Data frames (such as df1, df2, and df3) and then using that list in PandAS libraries. Additionally, you can include additional data frames in the same list and see them combined in this example.

One such operation is reversing a Pandas DataFrame, which may seem like a simple task, but it can be tricky if not done properly. In this article, we will explore the right way to reverse a Pandas DataFrame.What is a Pandas DataFrame?Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools. The primary data structure in Pandas is the DataFrame, which is a two-dimensional table-like structure that stores data in rows and columns. The rows represent the observations or samples, while the columns represent the variables or features of the data.Why Reverse a Pandas DataFrame?There are several reasons why you may need to reverse a Pandas DataFrame, including:Reversing the order of rows or columns to match a specific order or sequence.Reversing the order of data to visualize trends or patterns.Reversing the order of data to perform time-series analysis.How to Reverse a Pandas DataFrameThe most common way to reverse a Pandas DataFrame is by using the iloc method, which is a powerful indexing operator that allows you to select rows and columns based on their integer positions. The iloc method allows you to slice, select, and modify data in a Pandas DataFrame by using integer positions instead of labels.Reverse Rows in a Pandas DataFrameTo reverse the order of rows in a Pandas DataFrame, you can use the iloc method with a negative step value. The negative step value tells the iloc method to start from the last row and move backward by one row at a time.Output:As you can see, the iloc[::-1] method reversed the order of rows in the Pandas DataFrame.Reverse Columns in a Pandas DataFrameTo reverse the order of columns in a Pandas DataFrame, you can use the iloc method with a negative ste', 'Find centralized, trusted content and collaborate around the technologies you use most.TeamsTeamsQ&A for workConnect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search.Get early access and see previews of new features.Right way to reverse a pandas DataFrame?Here is my code:When I run this code, i get the following error:Why am I getting this error?

It also enables easy integration with other AI related tooling like LangChain, LlamaIndex, Cohere, and many others..Data security and access control: Vector databases typically offer built-in data security features and access control mechanisms to protect sensitive information, which may not be available in standalone vector index solutions. Multitenancy through namespaces allows users to partition their indexes fully and even create fully isolated partitions within their own index.In short, a vector database provides a superior solution for handling vector embeddings by addressing the limitations of standalone vector indices, such as scalability challenges, cumbersome integration processes, and the absence of real-time updates and built-in security measures, ensuring a more effective and streamlined data management experience.How does a vector database work?We all know how traditional databases work (more or less)they store strings, numbers, and other types of scalar data in rows and columns. On the other hand, a vector database operates on vectors, so the way its optimized and queried is quite different.In traditional databases, we are usually querying for rows in the database where the value usually exactly matches our query. In vector databases, we apply a similarity metric to find a vector that is the most similar to our query.A vector database uses a combination of different algorithms that all participate in Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search. These algorithms optimize the search through hashing, quantization, or graph-based search.These algorithms are assembled into a pipeline that provides fast and accurate retrieval of the neighbors of a queried vector. Since the vector database provides approximate results, the main trade-offs we consider are between accuracy and speed. The more accurate the result, the slower the query will be. However, a good system can provide ultra-fast search with near-perfect accuracy.Heres a common pipeline for a vector database:Indexing: The vector database indexes vectors using an algorithm such as PQ, LSH, or HNSW (more on these below). This step maps the vectors to a data structure that will enable faster searching.IndexingQuerying: The vector database compares the indexed query vector to the indexed vectors in the dataset to find the nearest neighbors (applying a similarity metric used by that index)QueryingPost Processing: In some cases, the vector database retrieves the f', 'TeamsTeamsQ&A for workConnect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search.How do vector databases work (for the lay-coder)?A vector database is a type of database that stores and manages unstructured data, such as text, images, or audio, in vector embeddings (high-dimensional vectors) to make it easy to find and retrieve similar objects quickly.How do you make that more tangible, to a software engineer?Some parts to answering this question:What is meant by "high dimensional" vectors? Does that just mean the array of numbers is a big array? Why is that important / highlighted?How is text, for example, converted to a vector of numbers (at a high level)?Why do they call them vector "embeddings"?I don\'t need to learn the theory of vectors, how can I understand vector databases practical function and use (as someone who wants to build an AI assistant), without learning about the theory of vectors exactly?I am an experienced software developer with experience with relational databases like PostgreSQL, and other databases like MongoDB (a doc database) or Neo4j (a graph database). So how does a vector database work exactly, at a high level? I just would like to have a practical sense of how it works, so I know what I\'m saving to when saving to pinecone, and what I\'m querying and maybe how a query roughly works.Relational databases are easy to understand. You just look at a spreadsheet, and the columns have names. Graphs are also easy to understand, you have your named models/types, and they have links between them. But vector databases? Is it literally a hashmap of key = something and value = array of numbers? Or what is it, how to get a practical sense like these other database types?References I\'ve used to get a slightly better understanding so far:https://towardsdatascience.com/explaining-vector-databases-in-3-levels-of-difficulty-fc392e48ab78 (unfortunately, pay-walled)https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/emb']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.5802104473114014, 0.6138512250109605]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}

Avector database uses a combination of different algorithms that all participate in Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search. These algorithms optimize the search through hashing, quantization, or graph-based search processes.These algorithms are assembled into a pipeline that provides fast and accurate retrieval of the neighbors of a query

Key technologies such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) were developed to support the representation and interlinking of data on the web.The advancement of graph theory and graph databases further contributed to developing knowledge graphs. Graph databases provided efficient storage and querying capabilities for graph-structured data, enabling the realization of large-scale knowledge graphs. The emergence of industry initiatives such as Google Knowledge Graph, Facebooks Social Graph, and Microsofts Academic Knowledge Graph showcased the practical applications and potential impact of knowledge graphs across different domains.As the field of machine learning progressed, knowledge graphs began to intersect with AI techniques. Embedding techniques, knowledge graph completion methods, and graph neural networks opened up new avenues for leveraging knowledge graphs in machine learning applications.Launch your project with LeewayHertz!With a deep understanding of and expertise in knowledge graphs, we build highly intelligent and context-aware AI systems suited to your business needs.How do knowledge graphs work?Knowledge graphs are a powerful tool for organizing and representing structured and connected knowledge. They are designed to capture and represent information in a machine-readable way and can be used for various applications such as search engines, question-answering systems, recommendation systems, and more. Here is an overview of how knowledge graphs work:Data integration: Knowledge graphs start with integrating data from various sources, including structured databases, unstructured text, and even real-time feeds. The data is processed and transformed into a standardized format to ensure consistency and interoperability.Data integration:Entity extraction: The next step involves identifying entities (or objects) within the data. Entities can be people, places, organizations, events, concepts, or any other type of information. For example, in a news article, entities could be the names of people mentioned, the locations discussed, or the topics covered.Entity extraction:Relationship extraction: Once the entities are identified, their relationships are extracted. Relationships describe how the entities are connected or related to each other. For instance, in the case of a person, relationships can include their affiliations, employment history, or social connections.Relationsh']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.6027414952228634, 0.7249976614994725]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}

2024_11_26 Model Response: The methodology employed by Cboe/Hanweck involves creating a volatility index based on American settlement-style options. This index can then be used to calculate both intra-day and end-of-year indicative prices for both existing or hypothetical option series. Specifically, the discrete dividend is derived from a hybridanalyst+algorithm system designed to forecast future dividend payments and dates associated with an array of securities across the global market. The algorithm employs a database of corporate actions to build up dividend payment patterns, identifying changes in shares in issue (through rightsissues, consolidations, bonus issues, and subdivisions), and recording various types of disbursements.

In order for people to survive, innovation and evolution was needed and achieved through the pursuit of novelty.[3]Novelty is defined as something that has not been previously experienced and/or deviates from ones routine.[4] Such examples include: meeting a new person, experiencing a new smell, taste, environment, or recreational activity - essentially, this can include any aspect of perception that isnt already present in an observers memory system.[5,6] When a new stimulus is encountered, the hippocampus is stimulated and releases dopamine into the body.[7,8] Acting as a reward system to encourage the pursuit of new stimuli and environments,[9] dopamine also activates long-term potentiation, facilitating learning and memory of the new stimulus.[10,11]If there is repetitive exposure to a stimulus, the body adapts by reducing the response to it - a process known as habituation.[12] Habituation allows the brain to ignore unimportant information and focus on new and relevant stimuli.[13] Specifically, the brain inhibits a response to stimulus that is familiar and frequently encountered, allowing selective attention to novel stimuli.[14] For example, an individual exposed to a constant smell will gradually show a reduced response until the smell is no longer perceived.[15] To encourage novelty seeking (which is evolutionarily advantageous) the body produces less dopamine (i.e., less of a reward) for repeated exposure to a stimulus.[16] Novelty as a psychological needResearch has demonstrated that novel exposure is positively associated with well-', 'ike a new trail.Explore a new park or hike a new trail.If you feel yourself suffering from boredom, feel disengaged in life, are suffering from anxiety or depression and the effects are not mitigated from increased experience of novelty, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for additional support.Contributed by: Amelia WorleyEditor: Jennifer (Ghahari) Smith, Ph.D.REFERENCES1 Schomaker, J.

When you scan a document, your scanner shines a light on the page and then processes this light with an array of sensors that convert it into electronic signals. This electronic signal is then sent to your computer for processing.The next step involves interpreting these electronic signals and converting them into digital data. In other words, optical character recognition (OCR) software uses pattern recognition to interpret what characters are written on the page or image and converts them into digital data that can be stored or manipulated within a software application such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat Reader.Also Read: Can AI Write the Dictionary?

JPG to text is an online tool that uses OCR for the conversion process. The process involves scanning the document, converting it into an image file (such as a TIFF or PDF), and then running OCR software on this image file. This allows you to extract all of the data from your document and save it as searc', 'n be repurposed or applied to create a new document for other purposes.The OCR technology helps in automating the data extraction process from machine-printed or typed text into a scanned document or PDF file format and then translating them into the machine-encoded format for reading, searching, and editing purposes. It should be noted that the OCR technology is highly dependent on the quality of the source paper copy and therefore scanned image.Any obstruction or diminished quality of the source hard copy text will inhibit the ability of the OCR technology to accurately convert the imaged character into text. It should also be noted that OCR technology is designed for the conversion of machine-printed text. Hand printed text and/or cursive printed text will not be easily recognized by OCR.There are a number of different OCR engines, one for each of the primary languages in the world. Paper documents authored in a specific language can easily be scanned and converted using the OCR engine of the corresponding language of the printed original.The application of OCR technology is a process that combines the mixture of both software (OCR engines) and hardware (document scanners) that turn paper documents into electronically-readable content.OCR Technology in Different VerticalsOCR is now used in different verticals where a large volume of paper documents accumulates such as the insurance sector, banking sector, healthcare sector, libraries, governmental agencies, and so on. Banking SectorThis is a sector where OCR technology is extensively used. For example, this tool is used when customers deposit checks in ATMs. Checks are scanned, signatures, amounts, bank acount numbers and routing numbers are automatically captured with no manual involvement. Healthcare SectorAnother sector where OCR technology is extensively used is the healthcare sector. OCR technology is helping Healthcare go paperless and ultimately improve the level of patient care by scanning medical records and storing them in a safe cloud storage drive securely and easily accessible anytime and anywhere.OCR technology plays a big part in the processing of medical claims, and maintaining patients medical history and records.

Multi-Agent Collaboration Multi-Agent CollaborationMulti-Agent CollaborationLLM agents participate in multi-agent systems, collaborating with one another and humans to tackle intricate problems requiring diverse perspectives and skills. Research and Development Research and DevelopmentResearch and DevelopmentThe research and development domain extensively explores the potential of LLM agents, with various frameworks and conceptual models evolving to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence. For example, Educhat, Chemcrow, and MetaGPT assist in solving complex mathematical, chemistry-related, and coding problems, respectively.As we wrap up our exploration of LLM Agents' practical applications, we've seen how they can revolutionize various fields, from customer service to data analysis. Now, let's move on to the next phase of learning how to construct an LLM Agent from scratch.How to Build LLM Agents?How to Build LLM Agents?In this section, we will source the code from this LLM Agents GitHub Repository and teach you how to build an intelligent agent that can execute tasks by using a combination of language models (LLMs) and custom-built tools. Here's a summary of how the agent works: Instruction by Prompt Instruction by PromptInstruction by PromptThe agent receives instructions through a prompt outlining the basic approach to solving a task using various tools. Custom-built Tools Custom-built ToolsCustom-built ToolsTools are custom-built components that the agent can utilize to perform specific tasks. These tools include the ability to execute Python code in a REPL, perform Google searches, and search on Hacker News. Loop of Thought, Action, and Observation Loop of Thought, Action, and ObservationLoop of Thought, Action, and ObservationThe agent operates in a loop, generating thoughts and actions based on the prompt using an LLM. It then observes the outcomes of these actions using the specified tools. Information Iteration Information IterationInformation IterationIn each loop cycle, the LLM receives new information appended to the prompt, allowing it to adapt its actions based on this information. Final Answer Final AnswerFinal AnswerTo use the agent, one needs to install the library locally, set up the required environment variables (such as `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `SERPAPI_API_KEY`), and then run the Python script run_agent.py` to ", 'r (Q&A) agents. What is an AI agent?While there isnt a widely accepted definition for LLM-powered agents, they can be described as a system that can use an LLM to reason through a problem, create a plan to solve the problem, and execute the plan with the help of a set of tools. In short, agents are a system with complex reasoning capabilities, memory, and the means to execute tasks.This capability was first observed in projects like AutoGPT or BabyAGI, where complex problems were solved without much intervention. To describe agents a bit more, heres the general architecture of an LLM-powered agent application (Figure 1).An agent is made up of the following key components (more details on these shortly):Agent coreMemory moduleToolsPlanning moduleAgent coreThe agent core is the central coordination module that manages the core logic and behavioral characteristics of an Agent. Think of it as the key decision making module of the agent. It is also where we define:General goals of the agent: Contains overall goals and objectives for the agent.General goals of the agentTools for execution: Essentially a short list or a user manual for all the tools to which the agent has accessTools for executionExplanation for how to make use of different planning modules: Details about the utility of different planning modules and which to use in what situation.Explanation for how to make use of different planning modulesRelevant Memory: This is a dynamic section which fills the most relevant memory items from past conversations with the user at inference time. The relevance is determined using the question user asks.Relevant MemoryPersona of the Agent (optional): This persona description is typically used to either bias the model to prefer using certain types of tools or to imbue typical idiosyncrasies in the agents final response. Persona of the Agent (optional)Memory moduleMemory modules play a critical role in AI agents. A memory module can essentially be thought of as a store of the agents internal logs as well as interactions with a user. There are two types of memory modules:Short-term memory: A ledger of actions and thoughts that an agent goes through to attempt to answer a single question from a user: the agents train of thought.Short-term memory:Long-term memory: A ledger of actions and thoughts about events that happen between the user and agent.
