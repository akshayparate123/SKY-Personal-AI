The young woman, living with her cousin Bhaskar, is lured back to her hometown under the pretense of staging a stage play.

A stoner beggar who witnesses the abduction confirms the ghost's existence, but the group is left stunned by the prospect of the abducted women being held captive in an alternate dimension. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the girl is actually the spirit of Chandrabhan, an alcoholic and womanizer who beheaded her husband and burned them alive in front of her daughter. After her death, Chandabhan returned as a spirit to target progressive women. With the help of Vicky, Bittu, and Rudra, they manage to track down the missing women and ultimately defeat the evil spirit.

2024_10_05 Model Response: Sure sir, here�s the rephrased rendition of it.In 1952, a young man named Gotya fell deeply in love with Munni, but fate had other plans for him. As fate would have it, Munjya, the malevolent spirit, took him to a dense jungle called Chetukwadi to perform black magic under a peepal tree. Despite his best efforts to protect his sister, Bittu ultimately met his untimely demise when he tried to sacrifice his own body. This event led to the emergence of Munji, an evil spirit that haunts the tree and threatens to take over the world.

Years later, in the bustling city of Pune, Getya's grandmother, Gita, was killed while trying to save him from Munja's clutches. Driven by love for his beloved, he sought help from an exorcist named Elvis, who devised a plan to transfer the spirit to another man. However, things took a turn for the worse when Bela's boyfriend, Kuba, proposed to her, leaving him heartbroken. It wasn't until she returned from her studies in America that Gotu learned about her true nature.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2:� A road construction project in India's Arunachal Pradesh state has been canceled after two people were killed by a werewolf, the Times of India reports. According to the Hindustan Times, road contractor Bhaskar and his cousin Janardan "JD" were visiting the forest in Ziro when they were bitten by the wolf on the backside. Anika, a local veterinarian, managed to save him, but the next day he started seeing changes in himself, including heightened senses of smell and hearing, as well as communication with animals. Meanwhile, locals and tribals were against the idea of chopping down trees to build roads. The project was canceled. It was later revealed that Anikar had been the victim of a wolf attack a century ago. She says she was responsible for killing anyone who tried to kill the animal and has no control over it.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2:� It�s been a while since the term �artificial intelligence� was coined, but a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that it may soon be obsolete. The study, which looked at more than 1,000 artificial intelligence systems, found that the number of people living in countries where AI is already prevalent has dropped from 1.5 million to just over 1 million over the past 20 years, reports the Washington Post. That number is expected to continue to drop as more people move to countries with high levels of AI, such as China and India, where the rate of population growth has been outpacing that of those in developed countries, the Post notes. "We are seeing a slow, steady decline in AI as a whole," says the lead author of the study. In fact, by 2050, only a handful of countries will have machines that can perform tasks that are comparable to those of a human, according to a press release. And that number could drop to as few as 100 million by 2040, meaning AI will be mostly confined to developing countries that have large amounts of human-like population centers. (In other AI news, researchers are working on ways to make robots smarter.)

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2: When it comes to computers, there are a lot of things you just don't know about. For example, how many computers are there in the world? How many of them are connected to each other? And what kind of information do they have? Well, the answer to these questions isn't quite as clear as you might think, according to a new study by the University of California at Berkeley. The researchers looked at how computers interact with one another, and found that most of the information they get comes from external sources, such as social media or other forms of communication, reports the Los Angeles Times. In fact, computers have more information about their environment than humans do, making them more likely to make decisions based on what they see as a "good situation" or "bad situation," the researchers write in a paper published in Science Advances. What's more, they say computers can learn more about other computers than we do about ourselves, which makes it easier for them to learn new things and improve their decision-making skills. "If you have a computer with a good environment, you can make better decisions," one researcher tells the Times, adding that computers may be able to "learn from the data" and make more informed decisions.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2: A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that computers can learn a lot more about language than ever before. The study, which looked at how computers learn to read, write, and communicate in a wide range of languages, found that humans are able to learn more than 70% of a language's vocabulary in just a few years, reports the Guardian. That's up from just 25% a decade ago, according to a press release from the study. "We have shown that the human brain is capable of learning a whole new language every day," the lead author says. It's no wonder, then, that researchers are so confident in their ability to write complex sentences with high levels of accuracy. In fact, the researchers say that by 2023, human language models could be used in fields such as bar exams, SAT tests, GRE testsand many other real-world applications. (In other words, it's not too far-fetched to say computers could soon be learning to speak, too.)

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2: We've all heard the saying, "intelligence is in the eye of the beholder." But it turns out that even the most complex forms of intelligencelike that of a waspcan't always be classified as such, according to a new study published in Nature Communications. The study, which looked at the behavior of more than 1,000 species of wasps, found that while most insects exhibit some level of "intelligent behavior" when they return to their burrows to find food, only a small percentage of them can be identified as having high levels of cognitive ability, reports the Guardian. In fact, the study's lead author says that in many cases, intelligence is simply a function of being able to adapt to new circumstances, rather than a trait. "Intelligence is a combination of many diverse abilities," he says, including problem-solving, logical reasoning, and the ability to make decisions quickly and efficiently. And while there may be some overlap between intelligence and other cognitive abilities, it's important to note that there's no one trait that can reliably predict intelligence.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2: Its not every day we hear about a math problem that requires the use of deductive reasoning, but that's exactly what happens in the realm of artificial intelligence, according to a new study. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, used statistical models to determine that the probability of a certain event occurring is 1 in 100,000, reports the Los Angeles Times. They compared that with the chance of an event happening in any given scenario, and found that odds of it occurring were one in 10 million. This is one of the strongest cases of statistical inference we have ever seen, says the lead researcher. The study builds on previous work that has shown that such a scenario can be predicted with high confidence. In other words, the results of this experiment could be used to predict future events in a way that makes sense based on the available data.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2:In the realm of problem-solving algorithms, there are two main types: specialized and non-specialized. The former is tailored to a particular problem, while the latter takes advantage of the specific circumstances in which the problem is being solved. For instance, consider a problem that involves finding the winning move (or sequence of moves) in a board game, creating mathematical proofs, and manipulating "virtual objects" in the form of computers.
