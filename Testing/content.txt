The young woman, living with her cousin Bhaskar, is lured back to her hometown under the pretense of staging a stage play.

A stoner beggar who witnesses the abduction confirms the ghost's existence, but the group is left stunned by the prospect of the abducted women being held captive in an alternate dimension. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the girl is actually the spirit of Chandrabhan, an alcoholic and womanizer who beheaded her husband and burned them alive in front of her daughter. After her death, Chandabhan returned as a spirit to target progressive women. With the help of Vicky, Bittu, and Rudra, they manage to track down the missing women and ultimately defeat the evil spirit.

2024_10_05 Model Response: Sure sir, here�s the rephrased rendition of it.In 1952, a young man named Gotya fell deeply in love with Munni, but fate had other plans for him. As fate would have it, Munjya, the malevolent spirit, took him to a dense jungle called Chetukwadi to perform black magic under a peepal tree. Despite his best efforts to protect his sister, Bittu ultimately met his untimely demise when he tried to sacrifice his own body. This event led to the emergence of Munji, an evil spirit that haunts the tree and threatens to take over the world.

Years later, in the bustling city of Pune, Getya's grandmother, Gita, was killed while trying to save him from Munja's clutches. Driven by love for his beloved, he sought help from an exorcist named Elvis, who devised a plan to transfer the spirit to another man. However, things took a turn for the worse when Bela's boyfriend, Kuba, proposed to her, leaving him heartbroken. It wasn't until she returned from her studies in America that Gotu learned about her true nature.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2:� A road construction project in India's Arunachal Pradesh state has been canceled after two people were killed by a werewolf, the Times of India reports. According to the Hindustan Times, road contractor Bhaskar and his cousin Janardan "JD" were visiting the forest in Ziro when they were bitten by the wolf on the backside. Anika, a local veterinarian, managed to save him, but the next day he started seeing changes in himself, including heightened senses of smell and hearing, as well as communication with animals. Meanwhile, locals and tribals were against the idea of chopping down trees to build roads. The project was canceled. It was later revealed that Anikar had been the victim of a wolf attack a century ago. She says she was responsible for killing anyone who tried to kill the animal and has no control over it.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2:� It�s been a while since the term �artificial intelligence� was coined, but a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that it may soon be obsolete. The study, which looked at more than 1,000 artificial intelligence systems, found that the number of people living in countries where AI is already prevalent has dropped from 1.5 million to just over 1 million over the past 20 years, reports the Washington Post. That number is expected to continue to drop as more people move to countries with high levels of AI, such as China and India, where the rate of population growth has been outpacing that of those in developed countries, the Post notes. "We are seeing a slow, steady decline in AI as a whole," says the lead author of the study. In fact, by 2050, only a handful of countries will have machines that can perform tasks that are comparable to those of a human, according to a press release. And that number could drop to as few as 100 million by 2040, meaning AI will be mostly confined to developing countries that have large amounts of human-like population centers. (In other AI news, researchers are working on ways to make robots smarter.)

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2: When it comes to computers, there are a lot of things you just don't know about. For example, how many computers are there in the world? How many of them are connected to each other? And what kind of information do they have? Well, the answer to these questions isn't quite as clear as you might think, according to a new study by the University of California at Berkeley. The researchers looked at how computers interact with one another, and found that most of the information they get comes from external sources, such as social media or other forms of communication, reports the Los Angeles Times. In fact, computers have more information about their environment than humans do, making them more likely to make decisions based on what they see as a "good situation" or "bad situation," the researchers write in a paper published in Science Advances. What's more, they say computers can learn more about other computers than we do about ourselves, which makes it easier for them to learn new things and improve their decision-making skills. "If you have a computer with a good environment, you can make better decisions," one researcher tells the Times, adding that computers may be able to "learn from the data" and make more informed decisions.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2: A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that computers can learn a lot more about language than ever before. The study, which looked at how computers learn to read, write, and communicate in a wide range of languages, found that humans are able to learn more than 70% of a language's vocabulary in just a few years, reports the Guardian. That's up from just 25% a decade ago, according to a press release from the study. "We have shown that the human brain is capable of learning a whole new language every day," the lead author says. It's no wonder, then, that researchers are so confident in their ability to write complex sentences with high levels of accuracy. In fact, the researchers say that by 2023, human language models could be used in fields such as bar exams, SAT tests, GRE testsand many other real-world applications. (In other words, it's not too far-fetched to say computers could soon be learning to speak, too.)

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2: We've all heard the saying, "intelligence is in the eye of the beholder." But it turns out that even the most complex forms of intelligencelike that of a waspcan't always be classified as such, according to a new study published in Nature Communications. The study, which looked at the behavior of more than 1,000 species of wasps, found that while most insects exhibit some level of "intelligent behavior" when they return to their burrows to find food, only a small percentage of them can be identified as having high levels of cognitive ability, reports the Guardian. In fact, the study's lead author says that in many cases, intelligence is simply a function of being able to adapt to new circumstances, rather than a trait. "Intelligence is a combination of many diverse abilities," he says, including problem-solving, logical reasoning, and the ability to make decisions quickly and efficiently. And while there may be some overlap between intelligence and other cognitive abilities, it's important to note that there's no one trait that can reliably predict intelligence.

2024_10_05 Model Response: agent_2: Its not every day we hear about a math problem that requires the use of deductive reasoning, but that's exactly what happens in the realm of artificial intelligence, according to a new study. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, used statistical models to determine that the probability of a certain event occurring is 1 in 100,000, reports the Los Angeles Times. They compared that with the chance of an event happening in any given scenario, and found that odds of it occurring were one in 10 million. This is one of the strongest cases of statistical inference we have ever seen, says the lead researcher. The study builds on previous work that has shown that such a scenario can be predicted with high confidence. In other words, the results of this experiment could be used to predict future events in a way that makes sense based on the available data.

2024_10_05 Model Response: In ancient times, a group of spiritual leaders from the Himalayas came face-to-face with the malevolent force known as Brahmastra, which possessed the power to obliterate the universe. These skilled beings harnessed their own astras to subdue the unpredictable nature of the Brahmansh, an enigmatic organization dedicated to safeguarding the world from its sinister might.

As fate would have it, in present-day Mumbai, Shiva finds himself smitten with Isha Chatterjee, who happens to be visiting India for the Durga Puja festival at her grandfathers palace.

2024_10_10 Model Response: agent_2: The world is mourning the death of India's richest man, Ratan Tata, who died Thursday at the age of Tatas Tata Steel Limited in Mumbai, India. Tata had been suffering from cancer for years, but his company, Tata Motors, was one of the world's largest and most valuable companies, according to the New York Times. The Times notes that Tata was worth more than $70 billion, making him worth as much as Bill Gates, Amancio Ortega, and Jeff Bezos combined. In a statement, the Indian conglomerate said Tata "gained another legacy, while losing one." "He showed us that true leadership isn't about being the loudest voice in the room or the heaviest hand on the table," the statement said.

BBC Future presents a four-minute animated guide to one of the greatest questions weve tried to solve.You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big space is,said the author Douglas Adams. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space. By our best estimates there are around 100 billion stars in the Milky Way and at least 140 billion galaxies across the Universe. If galaxies were frozen peas, there would be enough to fill an auditorium the size of the Royal Albert Hall.So how was this unimaginably giant Universe created? For centuries scientists thought the Universe always existed in a largely unchanged form, run like clockwork thanks to the laws of physics. But a Belgian priest and scientist called George Lemaitre put forward another idea. In 1927, he proposed that the Universe began as a large, pregnant and primeval atom, exploding and sending out the smaller atoms that we see today.His idea went largely unnoticed. But in 1929 astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the Unive", "imaginably giant Universe created? For centuries scientists thought the Universe always existed in a largely unchanged form, run like clockwork thanks to the laws of physics. But a Belgian priest and scientist called George Lemaitre put forward another idea. In 1927, he proposed that the Universe began as a large, pregnant and primeval atom, exploding and sending out the smaller atoms that we see today.His idea went largely unnoticed. But in 1929 astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the Universe isnt static but is in fact expanding. If so, some scientists reasoned that if you rewound the Universe's life then at some point it should have existed as a tiny, dense point. Critics dismissed this: the celebrated astronomer Fred Hoyle sarcastically called this concept the Big Bang theory, a phrase that would later be adopted by its proponents.Undeterred by sceptics, scientists Ralph Alpher, George Gamow and Robert Herman predicted that if there had been a Big Bang, then a faint afterglow should linger somewhere in the Universe, and we should in theory be able to detect it. To do so would require one of the greatest pieces of fortune in science.In the mid-1960s Astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were having a tough time trying to tune into the microwave signals transmitted from the Milky Way. The radio antenna they were using kept picking up a persistent weak hiss of radio noise. Rebuilding the antenna couldnt get rid of the noise. Nor could clearing the pigeons that had roosted in there, or their mess. Thats because the hiss they tried so hard to remove was the echo of the Big Bang, or the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation as it is known. If the Big Bang theory is true, how did it lead to all the planets, stars and galaxies we can see today? Thanks to a series of calculations, observations from telescopes on Earth and probes in space, our best explanation is this.Around 13.8 billion years ago, all the matter in the Universe emerged from a single, minute point, or singularity, in a violent burst. This expanded at an astonishingly high rate and temperature, doubling in size every 10-34 seconds, creating space as it rapidly inflated.

Specifically, ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight triggers the formation of vitamin D3 from the compound 7-dehydrocholesterol in skin (2). A similar process takes place in plants and mushrooms, where UVB light leads to the formation of vitamin D2 from ergosterol, a compound found in plant oils (3). If you regularly spend time outdoors, lightly clad and without sunscreen, you may be getting all the vitamin D you need.In Indian people, an estimated half an hour of midday sun twice a week provides the adequate amount (4).Just keep in mind that this duration of exposure does not apply in countries farther away from the equator. In these countries, you may need more time to achieve the same results.Nevertheless, be careful not to spend too much time in the sun without sunscreen. This is especially important if you have light-colored skin. Sunburns are a major risk factor for skin cancer (5).Unlike dietary vitamin D, you cannot overdose on vitamin D3 produced in your skin. If your body already has enough, your skin simply produces less. That said, many people get very little sun. They either work indoors or live in a country that doesnt get much sunlight during the winter.

These two compounds are collectively known as calcifediol. Calcifediol is the main circulating form of vitamin D, and its blood levels reflect your bodys stores of this nutrient.For this reason, your health care provider can estimate your vitamin D status by measuring your levels of calcifediol (6). However, vitamin D2 seems to yield less calcifediol than an equal amount of vitamin D3.Most studies show that vitamin D3 is more effective than vitamin D2 at raising blood levels of calcifediol (7, 8).For example, one study in 32 older women found that a single dose of vitamin D3 was nearly twice as effective as vitamin D2 at raising calcifediol levels (9).If you are taking vitamin D supplements, consider choosing vitamin D3.Summary Vitamin D3 appears to be better than D2 at improving vitamin D status.Summary Vitamin D2 Supplements Might Be Lower QualityScientists have raised concerns that vitamin D2 supplements might be lower quality than D3 supplements. In fact, studies suggest vitamin D2 is more sensitive to humidity and fluctuations in temperature. For this reason, vitamin D2 supplements may be more likely to degrade over time (10).However, whether this is relevant to human health is unknown. Also, no studies have compared the stability of vitamin D2 and D3 dissolved in oil. Until new research proves otherwise, you shouldnt worry about the quality of your vitamin D2 supplements. Simply make sure to store your supplements in a closed container, at room temperature, in a dry place and out of direct sunlight.Summary Vitamin D2 supplements may be more likely to degrade during storage. However, its unknown whether the same applies to oil-based vitamin D2. More studies are needed to examine the relevance of this to human health.Summary How to Improve Your Vitamin D StatusFortunately, there are many ways you can improve your vitamin D status. Below are a few ideas:Select mushrooms that have been exposed to ultraviolet light (11) Take fish oil supplements such as cod liver oilEat fatty fish twice a week (12) Choose milk or orange juice thats been fortified with vitamin DEat some eggs a']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None, None]], 'distances': [[0.838731542371959, 0.8390434828433945]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}

When exposed to sunlight, your skin produces vitamin d3 through the production of 7-dehydrocholesterol in skin (2). This same process occurs in plants and mushrooms, where UVB light leads to the formation of vitamin dioxide from ergosterol, a compound found in plant oils (3). Therefore, if you regularly spend time outdoors, lightly clad, and without sunscreen, you may be getting all the Vitamin D you need. Sunburns are a major risk factor for skin cancer (5), but you cannot overdose on this vitamin if your body already has enough. However, many people get very little sun.

Research Says MaybeThere may be some health benefits to smelling farts. However, having too much gas or gas that occurs with other symptoms may point to an underlying health condition. So youre lying in bed, cuddling with your partner, and you hear it.Maybe its a silent hiss, maybe its a voluminous blare. But you recognize the announcement of its arrival no matter what form it takes.Gas. Flatulence. A toot. A fart.But ignore your immediate instinct to leap out of bed and take shelter in the next room until the smell subsides. Recent research in animals suggests that hydrogen sulfide  one of the major components of smelly gas, the one that gives it that rotten egg smell  might provide some health benefits in humans, from preventing heart disease to kidney failure. Lets explore this seemingly odious notion and see what the research says. What the research says One 2014 study conducted by a collaborative research team at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom and University of Texas provides some ample support for the idea that smelling hydrogen sulfide could be good for you. The study was based on the notion that mitochondria, the part of your cells that help produce energy, could benefit from this gas.In this study, researchers noticed that when cells in arteries or veins experience damage or stress linked to certain conditions, these cells use the bodys own enzymes to create hydrogen sulfide. This gas then allows the cell to better regulate the oxidative stress often caused by these conditions, which eventually results in inflammation that can kill the cell. But as a condition becomes more severe, mitochondria cant produce enough of the gas to keep up, and the disease continues to get worse.Researchers thus decided to test a theory: Can exposing cells to artificial hydrogen sulfide help keep their mitochondria strong and prevent diseases from getting worse?So, they created a compound they named AP39 that mimicked hydrogen sulfide. They then exposed cells in blood vessels to it.The result?AP39 was just as good as natural hydrogen sulfide at helping mitochondria protect themselves from disease. Early results suggest that up to 80 percent of mitochondria exposed to AP39 are preserved by the gas. This could have far-reaching effects on many conditions linked to cell death caused by mitochondrial function. More research needs to be done on the interactions of AP39/hydrogen sulfide with other body systems, but early resul', 'Our product picks are editor-tested, expert-approved. We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us?Farting might be embarrassingespecially when its noticeable (sound, smell). But its actually important for your health.There are benefits to letting it rip throughout the day (most of them go undetected, anyway.) Farting can tell us a lot about our digestive health. Its actually very normal to pass gas over a dozen times a day, and lack of gas may indicate less diversity in lower digestive tract bacteria, says Kelly Jones MS, RD, CSSD, LDN, of Kelly Jones Nutrition. Having a diverse microbiome is important to good health in many ways, including improved mood and fitness performance, better heart health, and a healthier immune system. If you arent farting enough, see a doctor to better understand why and how to get things moving better in your digestive system. In the meantime, start making your microbiome more diverse with these strategies. But if you are farting frequently enough, heres what its doing for you: Farting is telling you youre getting good, complex carbs A diet rich in legumes, vegetables, fruits, whole grains nuts and seeds has long been associated with health benefits, and a healthy amount of flatulence can be indicative of this, says Jones. These foods provide fermentable fiber, resistant starches and oligosaccharides, which are all complex carbohydrates that good bacteria ferment and feed off of in the lower digestive tract. Gas is a byproduct of this fermentation, and thats what you release when you fart. So, by farting, you know youre getting a good variety of these types of fibrous foods to improve your gut health and the microbiome that helps keep it going.It improves colon healthYup, thats rightfarting can keep your colon happy now and lower the risk of colon complications in the future.

2024_10_23 Context(Action): {'ids': [['7788607525.04', '2897260573.04']], 'embeddings': None, 'documents': [['itionHow Much Iron Should You Be Getting Daily?How much iron you need can depend on your age and whether you are menstruating, pregnant, or nursing. The body absorbs certain types of iron differently.Too much or too little iron in your diet can lead to health issues like liver problems, iron-deficiency anemia, and heart damage (1).Naturally, you may wonder just how much iron is an ideal amount. Heres where it gets a little tricky.While generalized recommendations offer some guidance, your specific iron needs are influenced by many factors, including age, sex, and diet.This article discusses how much iron you may need, factors impacting those needs, and how to tell if youre not getting the right amount.Iron  what is it and why is it important?Iron is a nutrient that plays a vital role in oxygen transport. It binds to hemoglobin, a special protein, and helps it carry red blood cells from your lungs to other tissues in your body (1).Iron is naturally available in the foods you eat, and there are two main types  heme and nonheme iron.The term heme is derived from a Greek word that loosely translates to blood. This type of iron comes from animal protein, such as poultry, fish, and beef.On the other hand, nonheme iron comes from plant sources, including legumes, leafy greens, and nuts.Heme iron is easiest for your body to absorb and is 1418% bioavailable in mixed diets. Nonheme iron, the iron source in vegetarian diets, has a bioavailability of 512% (2).summaryIron is an essential nutrient. Two types of iron are found in the human diet  heme iron comes from animal protein, while nonheme iron comes from plants. Your body can absorb heme iron more readily.Sex and age influence your needsIron needs vary depending on sex and age.Infants and children (to age 13)Boys and girls iron needs from infancy and into late childhood are identical. This is because menstruation does not typically begin before age 13 (3).Newborn babies need the least amount of iron from their diet. Theyre born with a store of iron, absorbed from their mothers blood while in the womb. The Adequate Intake (AI) for infants from birth and up to the first 6 months is 0.27 mg daily. The AI is simply an average of what is normally consumed by healthy, breastfed infants. Thus, their needs are met through breastfeeding alone or from formula (4). Babies who spent less time in the womb, such as premature babies, need more iron than full-term infants. The same holds true for babies with low bi', '-heme iron from fruits, vegetables, beans, and other plant foods as easily as it absorbs heme iron. That means those who eat little or no meat must take in more iron from leafy greens, legumes, whole grains, mushrooms, and other iron-rich plant foods. They also need to get enough vitamin C, which helps the body absorb iron from food.The USDA recommends that women between the ages of 19 and 50 get 18 mg of iron a day, while women ages 51 and older and men 19 years and beyond need 8 mg a day. Moderate amounts of meat plus fruits and vegetables can provide that amount, helped along by the many foods fortified with iron and other vitamins and minerals, like milk, flour, and breakfast cereals. And half of all Americans get some iron from a daily multivitamin.One caution about iron: If you don\' think you are getting enough iron, or feel pooped out and assume it\'s your "tired blood," you may be tempted to pop an iron supplement as insurance. But beware. The body does not excrete iron rapidly. That means it can build up over time and, in some people, becomes toxic. The genetic disorder hemochromatosis causes iron to build up in organs, causing heart failure and diabetes.So don\'t just prescribe yourself an iron supplement on a whim; ask your doctor if you need it.Good sources of ironFoodPortionIron content (milligrams) Disclaimer: As a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.

BBC Future presents a four-minute animated guide to one of the greatest questions weve tried to solve.You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big space is,said the author Douglas Adams. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.

But in 1929 astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the Universe isnt static but is in fact expanding. If so, some scientists reasoned that if you rewound the Universe's life then at some point it should have existed as a tiny, dense point. Critics dismissed this: the celebrated astronomer Fred Hoyle sarcastically called this concept the Big Bang theory, a phrase that would later be adopted by its proponents.Undeterred by sceptics, scientists Ralph Alpher, George Gamow and Robert Herman predicted that if there had been a Big Bang, then a faint afterglow should linger somewhere in the Universe, and we should in theory be able to detect it. To do so would require one of the greatest pieces of fortune in science.In the mid-1960s Astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were having a tough time trying to tune into the microwave signals transmitted from the Milky Way. The radio antenna they were using kept picking up a persistent weak hiss of radio noise. Rebuilding the antenna couldnt get rid of the noise. Nor could clearing the pigeons that had roosted in there, or their mess. Thats because the hiss they tried so hard to remove was the echo of the Big Bang, or the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation as it is known. If the Big Bang theory is true, how did it lead to all the planets, stars and galaxies we can see today? Thanks to a series of calculations, observations from telescopes on Earth and probes in space, our best explanation is this.Around 13.8 billion years ago, all the matter in the Universe emerged from a single, minute point, or singularity, in a violent burst. This expanded at an astonishingly high rate and temperature, doubling in size every 10-34 seconds, creating space as it rapidly inflated.

For centuries scientists thought the Universe always existed in a largely unchanged form, run like clockwork thanks to the laws of physics. But a Belgian priest and scientist called George Lemaitre put forward another idea. In 1927, he proposed that the Universe began as a large, pregnant and primeval atom, exploding and sending out the smaller atoms that we see today.His idea went largely unnoticed. But in 1929 astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the Universe isnt static but is in fact expanding. If so, some scientists reasoned that if you rewound the Universe's life then at some point it should have existed as a tiny, dense point. Critics dismissed this: the celebrated astronomer Fred Hoyle sarcastically called this concept the Big Bang theory, a phrase that would later be adopted by its proponents.Undeterred by sceptics, scientists Ralph Alpher, George Gamow and Robert Herman predicted that if there had been a Big Bang, then a faint afterglow should linger somewhere in the Universe, and we should in theory be able to detect it. To do so would require one of the greatest pieces of fortune in science.In the mid-1960s Astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were having a tough time trying to tune into the microwave signals transmitted from the Milky Way. The radio antenna they were using kept picking up a persistent weak hiss of radio noise. Rebuilding the antenna couldnt get rid of the noise. Nor could clearing the pigeons that had roosted in there, or their mess. Thats because the hiss they tried so hard to remove was the echo of the Big Bang, or the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation as it is known. If the Big Bang theory is true, how did it lead to all the planets, stars and galaxies we can see today? Thanks to a series of calculations, observations from telescopes on Earth and probes in space, our best explanation is this.Around 13.8 billion years ago, all the matter in the Universe emerged from a single, minute point, or singularity, in a violent burst. This expanded at an astonishingly high rate and temperature, doubling in size every 10-34 seconds, creating space as it rapidly inflated. Within a tiny fraction of a second gravity and all the other forces were formed. Energy changed into particles of matter and antimatter, which largely destroyed each other. But luckily for us some matter survived.

AnimalsPropylene glycol is an approved food additive for dog and sugar glider food under the category of animal feed and is generally recognized as safe for dogs,[63] with an LD50 of 9 mL/kg. The LD50 is higher for most laboratory animals (20 mL/kg).[64] However, it is prohibited for use in food for cats due to links to Heinz body formation and a reduced lifespan of red blood cells.[65] Heinz body formation from MPG has not been observed in dogs, cattle, or humans. PG has been used in the dairy industry since the 1950s for cows showing signs of ketosis. The negative energy balance during the early stages of lactation can cause the animal\'s body to have lower glucose levels, inducing the liver to make up for this by the conversion of body fat, leading to several health conditions, e.g. displaced abomasum.[66] PG "reduces the propionate ratio of acetate to acetaminophen, while increasing conversion of ruminal PG to propionate, and aid[s] in the closure of energy deficit in cattle."[66] Allergic reactionEstimates on the prevalence of propylene glycol allergy range from 0.8% (10% propylene glycol in aqueous solution) to 3.5% (30% propylene glycol in aqueous solution).[67][68][69] The North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) data from 1996 to 2006 showed that the most common site for propylene glycol contact dermatitis was the face (25.9%), followed by a generalized or scattered pattern (23.7%).[67] Investigators believe that the incidence of allergic contact dermatitis to propylene glycol may be greater than 2% in patients with eczema or fungal infections, which are very common in countries with lesser sun exposure and lower-than-normal vitamin D balances. Therefore, propylene glycol allergy is more common in those countries.[70] Because of its potential for allergic reactions and frequent use across a variety of topical and systemic products, propylene glycol was named the American Contact Dermatitis Society\'s Allergen of the Year for 2018.[71][72] Recent publication from The Mayo Clinic reported 0.85% incidence of positive patch tests to propylene glycol (100/11,738 patients) with an overall irritant rate of 0.35% (41/11,738 patients) during a 20-year period of 19972016.[73] 87% of the reactions were classified as weak and 9% as strong.

But recent observations of distant supernovae and other observations show that the Universe is not only expanding, but the expansion is accelerating. This astonishing discovery came as a complete surprise because the expansion of the Universe should slow down with time because of the gravitational attraction between galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The unseen repellant force required to explain this observation has been labelled dark energy, and current models say it makes up about 68% of the Universe.That leaves only 5% of the Universe that is visible to us. Supernova 1994D in this image from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope might look like a star, but it's the explosion of a white dwarf that nearly outshone an entire galaxy. Such supernovas  known as type Ia  are extremely similar to each other, allowing astronomers to use them to measure the rate of the expansion of the universe. What We Know and What We ThinkWhile we cant see dark matter, we know its there. And we can investigate some of dark matters properties using gravitational lensing. This technique measures the gravitational pull galaxies exert on light from more distant sources. The warping and magnification of this light gives us insight into the amount, density, and distribution of dark matter in any given lensing galaxy. Theoretically, the current best explanation we have for dark matter is the existence of WIMPs, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. These theoretical particles should have certain predictable behaviors, but directly observing them and their byproducts so far has proved elusive.As for dark energy, Einstein had assumed the Universe was static, neither expanding nor collapsing. However, his Theory of General Relativity predicted that the Universe was not static, and so he added a cosmological constant, to oppose gravity. He later called it the biggest blunder of his life after Hubble demonstrated that the Universe was expanding.The discovery that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating revived the idea of the cosmological constant. The simplest interpretation of this constant is that it represents the energy of empty space.

Share Content on Facebook Share Content on LinkedIn Share Content on Flipboard Share Content on Reddit Share Content via Email The Earth, our celestial home, is in perpetual motion, gracefully rotating through space. This continuous rotation gives us the cycle of day and night, shapes our seasons, and influences our climate. Over geological time spans, it's gradually slowing down, which has led to speculation about what would happen if the Earth stopped rotating altogether.Let's take a closer look at this hypothetical scenario and explore the profound consequences of a motionless Earth, where the climate would shift dramatically and you could say  literally  the Earth stood still.AdvertisementContents Why Does Earth Spin? How Fast Does Earth Spin? What Would Happen if Earth Suddenly Stopped Rotating? Is Earth's Rotation Slowing Down? Sources Why Does Earth Spin? You have to admit, it doesn't feel like you're spinning around the center of the Earth at hundreds of miles an hour, so it's not hard to cut our scientific forebears some slack for assuming the planet was stationary and that the sun rotated around it.Thankfully, Copernicus set the record straight with his heliocentric model, and we now know that the Earth spins on its axis as it revolves around the sun. But why does our planet spin in the first place?AdvertisementRemember Newton's first law of motion? It states that an object remains in whatever state of motion it's in  unless another force acts upon it. Basically, the Earth is rotating because it's been doing that as long as it has existed.Before there were planets in our solar system, there was a spinning, nebulous cloud of dust with our sun at the center. Over time, these dust particles collided into one another and began to stick, forming larger and larger rocks and, ultimately, planets through a process known as accretion.But remember, the cloud of dust  or accretion disc  was rotating f", "D modelsFree DownloadsOnline 3D3D PrintingImagesVideosAnimationsOnline 3D3D PrintingImagesVideosAnimationsPhysics mysteriesLog-inCreate new accountPhysics mysteriesWhat would happen if the Earth stopped rotating?Jaroslav Kores, Ph.D.That would probably be pretty unpleasant, Im afraid it would almost immediately end all life on the Earth.The Earth rotates with a frequency of 1 rotation per 24 hours. By a fairly simple calculation, we can find out that at the equator, its speed is over 1,600 km/h (the closer to the poles, the slower the rotation speed).Since the law of inertia applies always and everywhere, what would happen would be that all things at rest relative to the Earth would continue to move at 1,600 km/h in the direction of the Earths rotation.So all the houses/towers/trees/rocks would be torn off the surface, water would pour out of the rivers and seas, dust would rise and people, cars or animals would fly in all of it.To prove the effect of a speed of 1,600 km/h, we can look at the Beaufort wind scale  it ends at a hurricane, which has a speed of about 120 km/h and more.So the strongest wind that destroys houses is 13 times weaker than what the wind speed would be if the Earth stopped rotating.I can not fully believe that we would be able to hide somewhere  everything on the surface would be destroyed, it would probably be quite difficult to get out of the underground (I would not expect that the entrance to the bunker would remain freely accessible).But even if we got outside, it would take many years for the dust to fall back to the ground and therefore the Suns rays would not reach the surface, which would cause both great cooling and the extermination of plants.Without plants there would be no photosynthesis and without it there would be no oxygen, which is a vital element for the survival of animals.So we would creep into an extremely cold environment in which we would not be able to breathe and would not even provide us with any food.It would be best if we started each morning by saying that we are glad that the Earth is rotating and we hope that it will continue to do so.Want to ask something?Send us an e-mail with the subject Physics mysteries to the address:We can't wait to tackle your interesting questions!EASY LINKSLearningOnline 3D ModelsFree DownloadsGlossaryPhysics mysteriesABOUT USEnergy encyclopedia (EE) is the project of Simopt.

IQ Air, which measures pollution in 109 countries around the globe, considers measurements above 35.5 to be unhealthy for sensitive groups, levels between 55.5 and 150.4 to be unhealthy for all, and anything higher is either very unhealthy (150.5-250.4) or hazardous (250.5 or higher).Top 10 Countries with the Worst Air Pollution - PM2.5 exposure (g/m) - 2022While the IQ Air list is respectable, it is not the only available source of air pollution data. Using data from Seattle, Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the Health Effects Institute has released its own list ranking the levels of air pollution of 196 nations via the State of Global Air report.The Air Quality Index (AQI) used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency is slightly more lenient than the IQ Air scale (by about 50 g/m). Values of 0-100 are generally thought of as satisfactory. However, values from 101-200 are considered unhealthy for certain at-risk groups, values 201-300 are viewed as unhealthy for everyone, and levels above 300 are deemed hazardous for all.The cleanest countries in the world, as determined by the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), have high air quality, clean water, and strong environmentally-friendly policies and initiatives. These countries include Switzerland, France, and Denmark.As the damage from pollution has become more apparent, more countries are looking to green alternatives to prevent further damage to the Earth.

Chad's capital, N'Djamena, frequently grapples with dust storms that blanket the city. The country's increasing reliance on biomass as a primary energy source for cooking and heating continues to raise indoor pollution, with dire health implications for its population, particularly affecting vulnerable groups like children and women.2. IraqIraq's pollution has taken a sharp upward trajectory, moving from a PM2.5 concentration of 39.6 in 2019 to a startling 80.1 in 2022. This alarming rise points to escalating environmental challenges stemming from industrial growth, traffic congestion, and recurrent dust storms. The ongoing conflict makes the situation worse, damaging infrastructure and raising dust levels. Such urban centers as Baghdad are particularly affected, with residents facing the brunt of pollution from traffic and industrial activities, including significant contributions from the oil sector's gas flaring practices.3. PakistanPakistan's air quality saga is marked by fluctuations, with the PM2.5 concentration peaking at 74.3 in 2018, dipping to 59 in 2020, and climbing back to 70.9 in 2022. This seesaw pattern reflects the ongoing struggle against such air pollution sources as vehicle emissions, industrial discharges, and agricultural burning. Urban areas, notably Lahore and Karachi, are hotspots for hazardous air, impacting millions. The government's efforts to curb pollution face the uphill task of balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability. The Pakistan minister for climate change blamed India for Pakistan's smog; however, Pakistani citizens blame their government for simply not doing enough to monitor or combat the crisis.4. BahrainBahrain's journey through the pollution scale reveals a complex pattern, with a PM2.5 concentration that fluctuated from 59.8 in 2018, reduced to 39.7 in 2020, and then spiked to 66.6 in 2022. These fluctuations reflect the challenges posed by industrial emissions, heavy traffic, and regional dust storms.

When two or more independent variables are used to predict or explain the outcome of the dependent variable, this is known as multiple regression.Regression analysis can be used for three things:Forecasting the effects or impact of specific changes. For example, if a manufacturing company wants to forecast how many units of a particular product they need to produce in order to meet the current demand.Forecasting the effects or impact of specific changesForecasting trends and future values. For example, how much will the stock price of Lufthansa be in 6 months from now?Forecasting trends and future values.Determining the strength of different predictorsor, in other words, assessing how much of an impact the independent variable(s) has on a dependent variable. For example, if a soft drinks company is sponsoring a football match, they might want to determine if the ads being displayed during the match have accounted for any increase in sales.Determining the strength of different predictorsRegression analysis can be broadly classified into two types: Linear regression and logistic regression.Linear regressionlogistic regressionIn statistics, linear regression is usually used for predictive analysis. It essentially determines the extent to which there is a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In terms of output, linear regression will give you a trend line plotted amongst a set of data points. You might use linear regression if you wanted to predict the sales of a company based on the cost spent on online advertisements, or if you wanted to see how the change in the GDP might affect the stock price of a company.The second type of regression analysis is logistic regression, and thats what well be focusing on in this post. Logistic regression is essentially used to calculate (or predict) the probability of a binary (yes/no) event occurring. Well explain what exactly logistic regression is and how its used in the next section.2. What is logistic regression?Logistic regression is a classification algorithm. It is used to predict a binary outcome based on a set of independent variables.Ok, so what does this mean? A binary outcome is one where there are only two possible scenarioseither the event happens (1) or it does not happen (0). Independent variables are those variables or factors which may influence the outcome (or dependent variable).binary outcomeIndependent variablesSo: Logistic', 'TeamsTeamsQ&A for workConnect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search.linear regression with 3-dimensional pointsI\'ve been hunting around looking for a way to do this problem. I need to create a program to calculate linear regression for 100 3-dimensional points. I also have the matching outcomes of the points, so it\'s like a training set rather than a testing set. I\'m also instructed to consider the bias term, but I\'m not sure what that means.I can find good documentation for 2-dimensional points, but not for 3 dimensions. Since there\'s so many equations for doing XY data points, surely there\'s a similar equation set for XYZ points. I\'m not really desiring to be given the equation outright, but more interested in an understanding of the function and how it works, as well as how it\'s determined. Thanks to anyone who read and who can help me with this problem.regression $$ This is the website where I found some more information. It seems to only deal with 2-dimensional data though. easycalculation.com/statistics/learn-regression.php $$  user2828965 Commented Mar 1, 2014 at 20:49 2 $$ Welcome to CV. Can you clarify your question? Are you trying to predict Z as a function of X & Y, or are you trying to predict an outcome in another dataset from X, Y & Z here? If so, is there any way to establish a correspondence b/t a given triplet in this dataset (Xi, Yi, Zi) & a particular outcome in the other dataset (Oi)? You mention a "bias term", that terminology is more common in machine learning than statistics; are you trying to train something like a neural network, or do you want regular (OLS) regression in statistics? $$  gung - Reinstate Monica Commented Mar 2, 2014 at 0:10 $$ The Mathematica function FindFit[...] could achieve what you desire. $$  Joseph O\'Rourke Commented Mar 2, 2014 at 0:25 $$ I believe that the problem is asking to fit a line to 3-dimensional points.
